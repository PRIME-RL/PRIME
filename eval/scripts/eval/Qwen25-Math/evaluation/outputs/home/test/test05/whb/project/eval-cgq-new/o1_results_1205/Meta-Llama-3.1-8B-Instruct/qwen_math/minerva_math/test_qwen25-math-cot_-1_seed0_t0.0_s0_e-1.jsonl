We are asked to find the diameter of the image of a planet at the focus of the telescope, given that the angular diameter of the planet at the time of observation is $45^{\\prime \\prime}$.\n\n## Step 2:  To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of angular diameter and the relationship between the angular diameter, the focal length, and the diameter of the image. The angular diameter of an object is related to its actual diameter and the distance from the object to the observer. In this case, the angular diameter of the planet is given as $45^{\\prime \\prime}$, and we need to find the diameter of the image of the planet at the focus of the telescope.\n\n## Step 3:  We can use the formula for the angular diameter, which is given by $\\theta=\\frac{d}{D}$, where $\\theta$ is the angular diameter, $d$ is the actual diameter of the object, and $D$ is the distance from the object to the observer.

This implies that the angle between Manny's direction of motion and the direction to third base is $45^{\\circ}$.\n## Step 3:  We can use the Lorentz transformation for angles to relate the angle Manny sees to the angle an observer on the ground would see. The Lorentz transformation for angles is given by $\\tan \\theta' = \\frac{\\tan \\theta}{\\gamma (1 - \\beta \\cos \\theta)}$, where $\\theta'$ is the angle Manny sees, $\\theta$ is the angle an observer on the ground would see, $\\beta$ is the speed of Manny relative to the ground, and $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor given by $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$.\n## Step 4:  Since Manny sees third base at a $45^{\\circ}$ angle to his left, we can set $\\theta' = 45^{\\circ}$ and $\\theta = 90^{\\circ}$ in the Lorentz transformation equation.

However, this is not possible since $\\gamma$ is a real number. We need to reconsider our approach.\n## Step 7:  Let's re-examine the problem. Manny sees third base at a $45^{\\circ}$ angle to his left, which means that the angle between his direction of motion and the direction to third base is $45^{\\circ}$. This implies that the angle between his direction of motion and the direction to first base is also $45^{\\circ}$.\n## Step 8:  Since Manny is running towards first base, the angle between his direction of motion and the direction to first base is $45^{\\circ}$.

The interplanar spacing for the (200) plane is $d = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{h^{2} + k^{2} + l^{2}}} = \\frac{0.509 \\, \\text {nm}}{\\sqrt{2^{2} + 2^{2} + 0^{2}}} = \\frac{0.509 \\, \\text {nm}}{\\sqrt{8}} = 0.181 \\, \\text {nm}$.\n\n## Step 6:  Apply Bragg's Law\nWe can now apply Bragg's Law to find the angle of the $4^{\\text {th }}$ reflection: $2d \\sin \\theta = n \\lambda$. Rearranging the equation to solve for $\\theta$, we get $\\sin \\theta = \\frac{n \\lambda}{2d}$. Substituting the values, we get $\\sin \\theta = \\frac{4 \\times 0.071 \\, \\text {nm}}{2 \\times 0.181 \\, \\text {nm}} = 0.156$.\n\n## Step 7:  Calculate the angle\nTo find the angle $\\theta$, we take the inverse sine of both sides: $\\theta = \\sin ^{-1}(0.156) = 8.97^{\\circ}$.\n\n## Step 8:  Round the answer to 2 decimal places\nRounding the angle to 2 decimal places, we get $\\theta = 8.97^{\\circ}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8.97}$"], "pred": ["8.97"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

We are tasked with finding the atomic weight of this element in g/mole.\n\n## Step 2:  The first step is to calculate the volume of the unit cell of the BCC structure. The lattice constant (a) is given as $3.31 \\AA$, which is equivalent to $3.31 \\times 10^{-8} \\mathrm{cm}$.

This gives us the volume of a single atom.\n## Step 6:  Once we have the volume of a single atom, we can calculate the volume of the void space by subtracting the volume of the atoms from the molar volume.\n## Step 7:  The volume of the void space is then calculated by subtracting the total volume of the atoms from the molar volume of gold.\n## Step 8:  We will use the atomic radius to calculate the volume of a single atom and then multiply it by the number of atoms in a mole to get the total volume of the atoms.\n## Step 9:  The atomic radius of gold is $144 \\mathrm{pm}$, which is equivalent to $1.44 \\times 10^{-8} \\mathrm{cm}$.\n## Step 10:  The volume of a single gold atom is calculated as $(4/3) \\pi r^{3}$, where $r$ is the radius of the atom.\n## Step 11:  Substituting the value of the radius, we get the volume of a single gold atom as $(4/3) \\pi (1.44 \\times 10^{-8} \\mathrm{cm})^{3}$.\n## Step 12:  Multiplying this by Avogadro's number gives us the total volume of the atoms in a mole.\n## Step 13:  Subtracting this from the molar volume of gold gives us the void volume.\n## Step 14:  Performing the calculations, we get the void volume as $10.3 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3} / \\mathrm{mole} - (4/3) \\pi (1.44 \\times 10^{-8} \\mathrm{cm})^{3} \\times 6.022 \\times 10^{23}$.\n## Step 15:  After performing the calculations, we get the void volume as $10.3 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3} / \\mathrm{mole} - 1.67 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3} / \\mathrm{mole}$.\n## Step 16:  Therefore, the total void volume for gold at $27^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ is $8.63 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3} / \\mathrm{mole}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8.63}$"], "pred": ["8.63"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

Since the marginal cost of the orchard is 25 cents per apple and the price is 75 cents, the orchard will supply all 50 apples it can produce at this price.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from the orchard.\nThe total revenue from the orchard is the price per apple multiplied by the number of apples supplied. So, the total revenue from the orchard is 75 cents * 50 apples = 3750 cents.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the total revenue from the store at the given price of 75 cents per apple.\nSince the residents of Cambridge buy 150 apples in a day at 75 cents per apple, the total revenue from the store is 75 cents * 150 apples = 11250 cents.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total revenue from both the orchard and the store.\nThe total revenue from both sources is the sum of the revenues from the orchard and the store. So, the total revenue is 3750 cents + 11250 cents = 13750 cents.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the marginal revenue from the store.\nSince the store supplies any remaining apples demanded, the marginal revenue from the store is the price per apple multiplied by the number of apples supplied by the store. The store supplies 150 apples at 75 cents per apple, so the marginal revenue from the store is 75 cents * 150 apples = 11250 cents.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the marginal cost of the last apple sold.\nThe marginal cost of the last apple sold is the price at which the city sets the price of apples. Let's call this price x cents.\n\n## Step 7: Set up the equation for the total revenue.\nThe total revenue is the sum of the revenue from the orchard and the revenue from the store. The revenue from the orchard is 50x cents (since the orchard supplies 50 apples at the price x), and the revenue from the store is 150x cents (since the store supplies 150 apples at the price x). The total revenue is 50x + 150x = 200x.\n\n## Step 8: Set up the equation for the total cost.\nThe total cost is the sum of the cost from the orchard and the cost from the store. The cost from the orchard is 50 * 25 cents = 1250 cents (since the orchard supplies 50 apples at a marginal cost of 25 cents per apple). The cost from the store is 150 * (x - 75) cents (since the store supplies 150 apples at a marginal cost of x - 75 cents per apple). The total cost is 1250 + 150(x - 75).\n\n## Step 9: Set up the equation for profit maximization.\nThe profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. The profit is 200x - (1250 + 150(x - 75)).\n\n## Step 10: Simplify the profit equation.\nThe profit equation simplifies to 200x - 1250 - 150x + 11250 = 50x + 10000.\n\n## Step 11: Set the profit equal to zero to find the price that maximizes profit.\nTo find the price that maximizes profit, we set the profit equal to zero: 50x + 10000 = 0.\n\n## Step 12: Solve for x.\nSolving for x, we get x = -200.\n\n## Step 13: Since the price cannot be negative, we need to find the price that maximizes revenue instead of profit.\nTo find the price that maximizes revenue, we set the marginal revenue from the store equal to the marginal cost of the orchard. The marginal revenue from the store is 150x, and the marginal cost of the orchard is 25.\n\n## Step 14: Set the marginal revenue from the store equal to the marginal cost of the orchard.\n150x = 25.\n\n## Step 15: Solve for x.\nSolving for x, we get x = 25/150 = 1/6.\n\n## Step 16: Convert the fraction to cents.\nSince x is in cents, we can convert 1/6 to cents by multiplying by 100: (1/6) * 100 = 16.67.\n\n## Step 17: Round the price to the nearest cent.\nSince the price must be a whole number of cents, we round 16.67 to the nearest cent: 17.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{50}$"], "pred": ["50"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

The linear supply curve can be represented by the equation $P = c + dX_{s}$, where $P$ is the price and $X_{s}$ is the quantity supplied.\n\n## Step 2: Use the given information to find the equation of the demand curve\nWe are given that the price elasticity of demand is $-0.25$. The formula for price elasticity of demand is $\\frac{dP}{dX_{d}} \\cdot \\frac{X_{d}}{P} = -0.25$. We can rearrange this to get $\\frac{dP}{dX_{d}} = -\\frac{0.25P}{X_{d}}$.
