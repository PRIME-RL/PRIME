If $t_{1}, \\ldots, t_{k}$ are pairwise distinct points in the open unit interval $(0,1)$, then some $t_{i}$ is isolated from the other $t_{j}$ by an open subinterval of $(0,1)$ whose length is greater than or equal to $\\lambda$.\n\n\n\nLemma 2.

Suppose, if possible, that no $t_{i}$ is isolated from the other $t_{j}$ by an open subinterval of $(0,1)$ whose length is greater than or equal to $\\lambda$. Without loss of generality, we may (and will) assume that $0=t_{0}<t_{1}<\\cdots<t_{k}<t_{k+1}=1$. Since the open interval $\\left(t_{i-1}, t_{i+1}\\right)$ isolates $t_{i}$ from the other $t_{j}$, its length, $t_{i+1}-t_{i-1}$, is less than $\\lambda$. Consequently, if $k$ is odd we have $1=\\sum_{i=0}^{(k-1) / 2}\\left(t_{2 i+2}-t_{2 i}\\right)<\\lambda\\left(1+\\frac{k-1}{2}\\right)<1$; if $k$ is even, we have $1<1+t_{k}-t_{k-1}=$ $\\sum_{i=0}^{k / 2-1}\\left(t_{2 i+2}-t_{2 i}\\right)+\\left(t_{k+1}-t_{k-1}\\right)<\\lambda\\left(1+\\frac{k}{2}\\right)<1$. A contradiction in either case.\n\n\n\nProof of Lemma 2. Let $I_{0}$, respectively $I_{1}$, be the set of all indices $i$ in the range $2, \\ldots, k-1$ such that $m_{i}$ is even, respectively odd. Clearly, $I_{0}$ and $I_{1}$ form a partition of that range.

Arguing indirectly, we assume that there exists a good collection $\\mathcal{B}$ with $|\\mathcal{B}| \\geq 2 n-1$, and choose one such for the minimal possible value of $n$. Clearly, $n>2$.\n\n\n\nFirstly, we perform a different modification of $\\mathcal{B}$. Choose any $x \\in X$, and consider the subcollection $\\mathcal{B}_{x}=\\{B: B \\in \\mathcal{B}, x \\notin B\\}$. By our assumption, $\\mathcal{B}_{x}$ is not tight. As the union of sets in $\\mathcal{B}_{x}$ is distinct from $X$, either this collection is empty, or there exists an element $y \\in X$ contained in a unique member $A_{x}$ of $\\mathcal{B}_{x}$. In the former case, we add the set $B_{x}=X \\backslash\\{x\\}$ to $\\mathcal{B}$, and in the latter we replace $A_{x}$ by $B_{x}$, to form a new collection $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$. (Notice that if $B_{x} \\in \\mathcal{B}$, then $B_{x} \\in \\mathcal{B}_{x}$ and $y \\in B_{x}$, so $B_{x}=A_{x}$.)\n\n\n\nWe claim that the collection $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$ is also good. Indeed, if $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$ has a tight subcollection $\\mathcal{T}$, then $B_{x}$ should lie in $\\mathcal{T}$. Then, as the union of the sets in $\\mathcal{T}$ is distinct from $X$, we should have $\\mathcal{T} \\subseteq \\mathcal{B}_{x} \\cup\\left\\{B_{x}\\right\\}$. But in this case an element $y$ is contained in a unique member of $\\mathcal{T}$, namely $B_{x}$, so $\\mathcal{T}$ is not tight - a contradiction.\n\n\n\nPerform this procedure for every $x \\in X$, to get a good collection $\\mathcal{B}$ containing the sets $B_{x}=X \\backslash\\{x\\}$ for all $x \\in X$. Consider now an element $x \\in X$ such that $\\left|\\mathcal{B}_{x}\\right|$ is maximal. As we have mentioned before, there exists an element $y \\in X$ belonging to a unique member (namely, $B_{x}$ ) of $\\mathcal{B}_{x}$. Thus, $\\mathcal{B}_{x} \\backslash\\left\\{B_{x}\\right\\} \\subset \\mathcal{B}_{y}$; also, $B_{y} \\in \\mathcal{B}_{y} \\backslash \\mathcal{B}_{x}$. Thus we get $\\left|\\mathcal{B}_{y}\\right| \\geq\\left|\\mathcal{B}_{x}\\right|$, which by the maximality assumption yields the equality, which in turn means that $\\mathcal{B}_{y}=\\left(\\mathcal{B}_{x} \\backslash\\left\\{B_{x}\\right\\}\\right) \\cup\\left\\{B_{y}\\right\\}$.\n\n\n\nTherefore, each set in $\\mathcal{B} \\backslash\\left\\{B_{x}, B_{y}\\right\\}$ contains either both $x$ and $y$, or none of them.

First, we note a key property:\n\n\n\nClaim (Sign of $f$ ). $f$ attains wither only nonnegative values, or only nonpositive values.\n\n\n\nProof. This follows from the fact that the zero-set of $f$ is very sparse: if $f$ takes on a positive and a negative value, we can move $A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}$ from the negative value to the positive value without ever having them form a regular $2 n$-gon - a contradiction.\n\n\n\nThe strategy for showing $\\operatorname{deg} f \\geq 2 n$ is the following. We will animate the points $A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}$ linearly in a variable $t$; then $g(t)=f\\left(A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}\\right)$ will have degree at most $\\operatorname{deg} f$ (assuming it is not zero). The claim above then establishes that any root of $g$ must be a multiple root, so if we can show that there are at least $n$ roots, we will have shown $\\operatorname{deg} g \\geq 2 n$, and so $\\operatorname{deg} f \\geq 2 n$.\n\n\n\nGeometrically, our goal is to exhibit $2 n$ linearly moving points so that they form a regular $2 n$-gon a total of $n$ times, but not always form one.\n\n\n\nWe will do this as follows. Draw $n$ mirrors through the origin, as lines making angles of $\\frac{\\pi}{n}$ with each other. Then, any point $P$ has a total of $2 n$ reflections in the mirrors, as shown below for $n=5$. (Some of these reflections may overlap.)\n\n\n\nDraw the $n$ angle bisectors of adjacent mirrors. Observe that the reflections of $P$ form a regular $2 n$ gon if and only if $P$ lies on one of the bisectors.\n\n\n\nWe will animate $P$ on any line $\\ell$ which intersects all $n$ bisectors (but does not pass through the origin), and let $P_{1}, \\ldots, P_{2 n}$ be its reflections. Clearly, these are also all linearly animated, and because of the reasons above, they will form a regular $2 n$-gon exactly $n$ times, when $\\ell$ meets each bisector. So this establishes $\\operatorname{deg} f \\geq 2 n$ for the reasons described previously.\n\n\n\nNow we pass to constructing a polynomial $f$ of degree $2 n$ having the desired property. First of all, we will instead find a polynomial $g$ which has this property, but only when points with sum zero are input. This still solves the problem, because then we can choose\n\n\n\n$$\nf\\left(A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}\\right)=g\\left(A_{1}-\\bar{A}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}-\\bar{A}\\right)\n$$\n\n\n\nwhere $\\bar{A}$ is the centroid of $A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}$. This has the upshot that we can now always assume $A_{1}+\\cdots+A_{2 n}=0$, which will simplify the ensuing discussion.\n\n\n\n<img_3624>\n\n\n\nWe will now construct a suitable $g$ as a sum of squares. This means that, if we write $g=g_{1}^{2}+g_{2}^{2}+$ $\\cdots+g_{m}^{2}$, then $g=0$ if and only if $g_{1}=\\cdots=g_{m}=0$, and that if their degrees are $d_{1}, \\ldots, d_{m}$, then $g$ has degree at most $2 \\max \\left(d_{1}, \\ldots, d_{m}\\right)$.\n\n\n\nThus, it is sufficient to exhibit several polynomials, all of degree at most $n$, such that $2 n$ points with zero sum are the vertices of a regular $2 n$-gon if and only if the polynomials are all zero at those points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, we will impose the constraints that all $\\left|A_{i}\\right|^{2}=x_{i}^{2}+y_{i}^{2}$ are equal. This uses multiple degree 2 constraints.\n\n\n\nNow, we may assume that the points $A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}$ all lie on a circle with centre 0 , and $A_{1}+\\cdots+A_{2 n}=0$.

Suppose that $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ are complex numbers of the same non-zero magnitude, and suppose that $a_{1}^{k}+\\cdots+a_{2 n}^{k}=0, k=1, \\ldots, n$. Then $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ form a regular $2 n$-gon centred at the origin. (Conversely, this is easily seen to be sufficient.)\n\n\n\nProof. Since all the hypotheses are homogenous, we may assume (mostly for convenience) that $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ lie on the unit circle. By Newton's sums, the $k$-th symmetric sums of $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ are all zero for $k$ in the range $1, \\ldots, n$.\n\n\n\nTaking conjugates yields $a_{1}^{-k}+\\cdots+a_{2 n}^{-k}=0$, $k=1, \\ldots, n$. Thus, we can repeat the above logic to obtain that the $k$-th symmetric sums of $a_{1}^{-1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}^{-1}$ are also all zero for $k=1, \\ldots, n$. However, these are simply the $(2 n-k)$-th symmetric sums of $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ (divided by $a_{1} \\cdots a_{2 n}$ ), so the first $2 n-1$ symmetric sums of $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ are all zero. This implies that $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ form a regular $2 n$-gon centred at the origin.\n\n\n\nWe will encode all of these constraints into our polynomial. More explicitly, write $a_{r}=x_{r}+y_{r} i$; then the constraint $a_{1}^{k}+\\cdots+a_{2 n}^{k}=0$ can be expressed as $p_{k}+q_{k} i=0$, where $p_{k}$ and $q_{k}$ are real polynomials in the coordinates. To incorporate this, simply impose the constraints $p_{k}=0$ and $q_{k}=0$; these are conditions of degree $k \\leq n$, so their squares are all of degree at most $2 n$.\n\n\n\nTo recap, taking the sum of squares of all of these constraints gives a polynomial $f$ of degree at most $2 n$ which works whenever $A_{1}+\\cdots+A_{2 n}=0$.

In particular, if $y_{1}, y_{2}, \\ldots, y_{k}$ are primes for some $k \\geq 1$ then $a=x_{1}$ is also prime.\n\n\n\nNow we claim that for every odd prime $a$ at least one of the numbers $y_{1}, y_{2}, y_{3}$ is composite (and thus $k<3$ ). Assume, to the contrary, that $y_{1}, y_{2}$, and $y_{3}$ are primes; then $x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}$ are primes as well. Since $x_{1} \\geq 3$ is odd, we have $x_{2}>3$ and $x_{2} \\equiv 3(\\bmod 4)$; consequently, $x_{3} \\equiv 7$ $(\\bmod 8)$.

This expression can be factored as $2^{2^{n-1}a + (2^{n-1} - 1)} - 1 = (2^{2^{n-1}})^a - 1^a$, which is a difference of powers and can be factored using the difference of squares identity if $a$ is even, but not if $a$ is odd.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze the case when $a$ is odd\nIf $a$ is odd, then $2^{2^{n-1}a + (2^{n-1} - 1)} - 1$ cannot be factored into the product of two integers, making it a prime number.

This completes the induction step and ends the proof.\n\n### solution_3\nWe intend to count the number of good orientations of a Catalan $n$-configuration.\n\nFor each such configuration, we consider its dual graph $T$ whose vertices are finite regions bounded by chords and the circle, and an edge connects two regions sharing a boundary segment. This graph $T$ is a plane tree with $n$ edges and $n+1$ vertices.\n\nThere is a canonical bijection between orientations of chords and orientations of edges of $T$ in such a way that each chord crosses an edge of $T$ from the right to the left of the arrow on that edge. A good orientation of chords corresponds to an orientation of the tree containing no two edges oriented towards each other. Such an orientation is defined uniquely by its source vertex, i.e., the unique vertex having no in-arrows.\n\nTherefore, for each tree $T$ on $n+1$ vertices, there are exactly $n+1$ ways to orient it so that the source vertex is unique - one for each choice of the source.

A fictitious domino is good if it is completely covered by a domino in the arrangement; otherwise, it is bad.\n\n\n\nIf the fictitious dominoes are all good, then the dominoes in the arrangement that cover no fictitious domino, if any, all lie in two triangular regions of side-length $m-1$ at the upper-left and upper-right corners of the board. Colour the cells of the board chess-like and notice that in each of the two triangular regions the number of black cells and the number of white cells differ by $\\lfloor m / 2\\rfloor$.

A finite number of such transformations eventually leads to an arrangement of at least as many dominoes all of whose fictitious dominoes are good, and the conclusion follows by the preceding.\n\n\n\nConsider the row of minimal rank containing bad fictitious dominoes - this is certainly not the bottom row - and let $D$ be one such. Let $\\ell$, respectively $r$, be the left, respectively right, cell of $D$ and notice that the cell below $\\ell$, respectively $r$, is the right, respectively left, cell of a domino $D_{1}$, respectively $D_{2}$, in the arrangement.\n\n\n\nIf $\\ell$ is covered by a domino $D_{\\ell}$ in the arrangement, since $D$ is bad and no two dominoes in the arrangement form a square, it follows that $D_{\\ell}$ is vertical. If $r$ were also covered by a domino $D_{r}$ in the arrangement, then $D_{r}$ would also be vertical, and would therefore form a square with $D_{\\ell}-$ a contradiction. Hence $r$ is not covered, and there is room for $D_{\\ell}$ to be placed so as to cover $D$, to obtain a new arrangement satisfying the conditions in the statement; the latter has as many dominoes as the former, but fewer bad fictitious dominoes. The case where $r$ is covered is dealt with similarly.\n\n\n\nFinally, if neither cell of $D$ is covered, addition of an extra domino to cover $D$ and, if necessary, removal of the domino above $D$ to avoid formation of a square, yields a new arrangement satisfying the conditions in the statement; the latter has at least as many dominoes as the former, but fewer bad fictitious dominoes. (Figure 5 illustrates the two cases.)", "We present an alternative proof of the bound.\n\n\n\nLabel the rows upwards $0,1, \\ldots, m-1$, and the columns from the left to the right by $0,1, \\ldots, 2 n-1$; label each cell by the pair of its column's and row's numbers, so that $(1,0)$ is the second left cell in the bottom row. Colour the cells chess-like so that $(0,0)$ is white. For $0 \\leq i \\leq n-1$, we say that the $i$ th white diagonal is the set of cells of the form $(2 i+k, k)$, where $k$ ranges over all appropriate indices. Similarly, the ith black diagonal is the set of cells of the form $(2 i+1-k, k)$. (Notice that the white cells in the upper-left corner and the black cells in the upper-right corner are not covered by these diagonals.)\n\n\n\nClaim. Assume that $K$ lowest cells of some white diagonal are all covered by dominoes. Then all these $K$ dominoes face right or up from the diagonal. (In other words, the black cell of any such\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndomino is to the right or to the top of its white cell.) Similarly, if $K$ lowest cells of some black diagonal are covered by dominoes, then all these dominoes face left or up from the diagonal.\n\n\n\nProof. By symmetry, it suffices to prove the first statement. Assume that $K$ lowest cells of the $i$ th white diagonal is completely covered. We prove by induction on $k<K$ that the required claim holds for the domino covering $(2 i+k, k)$. The base case $k=0$ holds due to the problem condition. To establish the step, one observes that if $(2 i+k, k)$ is covered by a domino facing up of right, while $(2 i+k+1, k+1)$ is covered by a domino facing down or left, then these two dominoes form a square.\n\n\n\nWe turn to the solution. We will prove that there are at least $d=\\lfloor m / 2\\rfloor$ empty white cells. Since each domino covers exactly one white cell, the required bound follows.\n\n\n\nIf each of the first $d$ white diagonals contains an empty cell, the result is clear. Otherwise, let $i<d$ be the least index of a completely covered white diagonal. We say that the dominoes covering our diagonal are distinguished. After removing the distinguished dominoes, the board splits into two parts; the left part $L$ contains $i$ empty white cells on the previous diagonals. So, it suffices to prove that the right part $R$ contains at least $d-i$ empty white cells.\n\n\n\nLet $j$ be the number of distinguished dominoes facing up. Then at least $j-i$ of these dominoes cover some cells of (distinct) black diagonals (the relation $m \\leq n$ is used). Each such domino faces down from the corresponding black diagonal - so, by the Claim, each such black diagonal contains an empty cell in $R$. Thus, $R$ contains at least $j-i$ empty black cells.\n\n\n\nNow, let $w$ be the number of white cells in $R$. Then the number of black cells in $R$ is $w-d+j$, and at least $i-j$ of those are empty. Thus, the number of dominoes in $R$ is at most $(w-d+j)-(j-i)=w-(d-i)$, so $R$ contains at least $d-i$ empty white cells, as we wanted to show."], "answer_type": "Expression", "subfield": "Combinatorics", "code": ["## Step 1: Understand the constraints of the problem\nWe are given a rectangular board with $m$ rows and $2n$ columns, and we need to place dominoes (1x2 or 2x1 rectangles) on it.

Furthermore, if a divisible triple $(x, y, z)$ is bichromatic, then among $x, y, z$ there are either one blue and two red numbers, or vice versa. In both cases, exactly one of the pairs $(x, y),(y, z)$ and $(z, x)$ belongs to the set $R \\times B$. Assign such pair to the triple $(x, y, z)$.\n\nConversely, consider any pair $(x, y) \\in R \\times B$, and denote $z=z_{x, y}$. Since $x \\neq y$, the triples $(x, y, z),(y, z, x)$ and $(z, x, y)$ are distinct, and $(x, y)$ is assigned to each of them. On the other hand, if $(x, y)$ is assigned to some triple, then this triple is clearly one of those mentioned above. So each pair in $R \\times B$ is assigned exactly three times.\n\nThus, the number of bichromatic divisible triples is three times the number of elements in $R \\times B$, and the number of monochromatic ones is $n^{2}-3 r b=(r+b)^{2}-3 r b=r^{2}-r b+b^{2}$, as claimed.\n\nSo, to find all values of $n$ for which the desired coloring is possible, we have to find all $n$, for which there exists a decomposition $n=r+b$ with $r^{2}-r b+b^{2}=2007$.

Let's denote the number of red numbers in $S$ as $r$ and the number of blue numbers as $b$. We have the equation $r + b = n$.\n## Step 3:  We then consider the condition that $x+y+z$ is divisible by $n$. This implies that the sum of the three numbers must be a multiple of $n$. We can express this as $x+y+z \\equiv 0 \\pmod{n}$.\n## Step 4:  We can further simplify this condition by considering the possible remainders of $x, y,$ and $z$ when divided by $n$. We can express $x, y,$ and $z$ as $x = nq_1 + a, y = nq_2 + b, z = nq_3 + c$, where $a, b, c$ are the remainders when $x, y,$ and $z$ are divided by $n$ respectively.\n## Step 5:  Substituting these expressions into the equation $x+y+z \\equiv 0 \\pmod{n}$, we get $n(q_1 + q_2 + q_3) + (a+b+c) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{n}$.

Let $A^{\\prime}, B^{\\prime}, C^{\\prime}$ be the midpoints of sides $B C, C A$ and $A B$, respectively.\n\nSuppose that two of points $A_{1}, B_{1}, C_{1}$ lie in one of triangles $A C^{\\prime} B^{\\prime}, B A^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}$ and $C B^{\\prime} A^{\\prime}$ (for convenience, let points $B_{1}$ and $C_{1}$ lie in triangle $A C^{\\prime} B^{\\prime}$; see Figure 2).

Then lines $B_{1} A_{1}$ and $A B$ intersect at a point $Y$ on the extension of $A B$ beyond point $B$, hence $\\frac{\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]}{\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C^{\\prime}\\right]}=\\frac{C_{1} Y}{C^{\\prime} Y}>1$; also, lines $A_{1} C^{\\prime}$ and $C A$ intersect at a point $Z$ on the extension of $C A$ beyond point $A$, hence $\\frac{\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C^{\\prime}\\right]}{\\left[A_{1} B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}\\right]}=\\frac{B_{1} Z}{B^{\\prime} Z}>1$. Finally, since $A_{1} A^{\\prime} \\| B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}$, we have $\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]>\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C^{\\prime}\\right]>\\left[A_{1} B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}\\right]=\\left[A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}\\right]=\\frac{1}{4}[A B C]$.\n\n\n\nNow, from $\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]+\\left[A C_{1} B_{1}\\right]+\\left[B A_{1} C_{1}\\right]+\\left[C B_{1} A_{1}\\right]=[A B C]$ we obtain that one of the remaining triangles $A C_{1} B_{1}, B A_{1} C_{1}, C B_{1} A_{1}$ has an area less than $\\frac{1}{4}[A B C]$, so it is less than $\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]$.\n\nNow we return to the problem. We say that triangle $A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}$ is small if $\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]$ is less than each of $\\left[B B_{1} A_{1}\\right]$ and $\\left[C C_{1} B_{1}\\right]$; otherwise this triangle is big (the similar notion is introduced for triangles $B_{1} C_{1} D_{1}, C_{1} D_{1} A_{1}, D_{1} A_{1} B_{1}$ ). If both triangles $A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}$ and $C_{1} D_{1} A_{1}$ are big, then $\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]$ is not less than the area of some border triangle, and $\\left[C_{1} D_{1} A_{1}\\right]$ is not less than the area of another one; hence, $S_{1}=\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]+\\left[C_{1} D_{1} A_{1}\\right] \\geq S$. The same is valid for the pair of $B_{1} C_{1} D_{1}$ and $D_{1} A_{1} B_{1}$. So it is sufficient to prove that in one of these pairs both triangles are big.\n\nSuppose the contrary. Then there is a small triangle in each pair. Without loss of generality, assume that triangles $A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}$ and $D_{1} A_{1} B_{1}$ are small. We can assume also that $\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right] \\leq$ $\\left[D_{1} A_{1} B_{1}\\right]$.

In the sequel, the word collision will be used to denote meeting of exactly two ants, moving in opposite directions.\n\nIf at the beginning we place an ant on the southwest corner square facing east and an ant on the southeast corner square facing west, then they will meet in the middle of the bottom row at time $\\frac{m-1}{2}$. After the collision, the ant that moves to the north will stay on the board for another $m-\\frac{1}{2}$ time units and thus we have established an example in which the last ant falls off at time $\\frac{m-1}{2}+m-\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{3 m}{2}-1$. So, we are left to prove that this is the latest possible moment.\n\nConsider any collision of two ants $a$ and $a^{\\prime}$. Let us change the rule for this collision, and enforce these two ants to turn anticlockwise. Then the succeeding behavior of all the ants does not change; the only difference is that $a$ and $a^{\\prime}$ swap their positions. These arguments may be applied to any collision separately, so we may assume that at any collision, either both ants rotate clockwise or both of them rotate anticlockwise by our own choice.\n\nFor instance, we may assume that there are only two types of ants, depending on their initial direction: NE-ants, which move only north or east, and $S W$-ants, moving only south and west. Then we immediately obtain that all ants will have fallen off the board after $2 m-1$ time units. However, we can get a better bound by considering the last moment at which a given ant collides with another ant.\n\nChoose a coordinate system such that the corners of the checkerboard are $(0,0),(m, 0),(m, m)$ and $(0, m)$. At time $t$, there will be no NE-ants in the region $\\{(x, y): x+y<t+1\\}$ and no SW-ants in the region $\\{(x, y): x+y>2 m-t-1\\}$.

We begin with an example showing that there can exist 3986729 cells carrying the same positive number.\n\n<img_3188>\n\nTo describe it, we number the columns from the left to the right and the rows from the bottom to the top by $1,2, \\ldots, 2011$. We will denote each napkin by the coordinates of its lowerleft cell. There are four kinds of napkins: first, we take all napkins $(52 i+36,52 j+1)$ with $0 \\leq j \\leq i \\leq m-2$; second, we use all napkins $(52 i+1,52 j+36)$ with $0 \\leq i \\leq j \\leq m-2$; third, we use all napkins $(52 i+36,52 i+36)$ with $0 \\leq i \\leq m-2$; and finally the napkin $(1,1)$. Different groups of napkins are shown by different types of hatchings in the picture.\n\nNow except for those squares that carry two or more different hatchings, all squares have the number 1 written into them. The number of these exceptional cells is easily computed to be $\\left(52^{2}-35^{2}\\right) m-17^{2}=57392$.\n\nWe are left to prove that 3986729 is an upper bound for the number of cells containing the same number. Consider any configuration of napkins and any positive integer $M$. Suppose there are $g$ cells with a number different from $M$. Then it suffices to show $g \\geq 57392$. Throughout the solution, a line will mean either a row or a column.\n\nConsider any line $\\ell$. Let $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{52 m-17}$ be the numbers written into its consecutive cells. For $i=1,2, \\ldots, 52$, let $s_{i}=\\sum_{t \\equiv i(\\bmod 52)} a_{t}$. Note that $s_{1}, \\ldots, s_{35}$ have $m$ terms each, while $s_{36}, \\ldots, s_{52}$ have $m-1$ terms each. Every napkin intersecting $\\ell$ contributes exactly 1 to each $s_{i}$;\n\n\n\nhence the number $s$ of all those napkins satisfies $s_{1}=\\cdots=s_{52}=s$. Call the line $\\ell$ rich if $s>(m-1) M$ and poor otherwise.\n\nSuppose now that $\\ell$ is rich. Then in each of the sums $s_{36}, \\ldots, s_{52}$ there exists a term greater than $M$; consider all these terms and call the corresponding cells the rich bad cells for this line. So, each rich line contains at least 17 cells that are bad for this line.\n\nIf, on the other hand, $\\ell$ is poor, then certainly $s<m M$ so in each of the sums $s_{1}, \\ldots, s_{35}$ there exists a term less than $M$; consider all these terms and call the corresponding cells the poor bad cells for this line. So, each poor line contains at least 35 cells that are bad for this line.\n\nLet us call all indices congruent to $1,2, \\ldots$, or 35 modulo 52 small, and all other indices, i.e. those congruent to $36,37, \\ldots$, or 52 modulo 52 , big. Recall that we have numbered the columns from the left to the right and the rows from the bottom to the top using the numbers $1,2, \\ldots, 52 m-17$; we say that a line is big or small depending on whether its index is big or small. By definition, all rich bad cells for the rows belong to the big columns, while the poor ones belong to the small columns, and vice versa.\n\nIn each line, we put a strawberry on each cell that is bad for this line. In addition, for each small rich line we put an extra strawberry on each of its (rich) bad cells. A cell gets the strawberries from its row and its column independently.\n\nNotice now that a cell with a strawberry on it contains a number different from $M$. If this cell gets a strawberry by the extra rule, then it contains a number greater than $M$. Moreover, it is either in a small row and in a big column, or vice versa. Suppose that it is in a small row, then it is not bad for its column. So it has not more than two strawberries in this case. On the other hand, if the extra rule is not applied to some cell, then it also has not more than two strawberries. So, the total number $N$ of strawberries is at most $2 g$.\n\nWe shall now estimate $N$ in a different way. For each of the $2 \\cdot 35 \\mathrm{~m}$ small lines, we have introduced at least 34 strawberries if it is rich and at least 35 strawberries if it is poor, so at least 34 strawberries in any case. Similarly, for each of the $2 \\cdot 17(m-1)$ big lines, we put at least $\\min (17,35)=17$ strawberries.

Let $S=35, H=17, m=39$; so the table size is $2011=S m+H(m-1)$, and the napkin size is $52=S+H$. Fix any positive integer $M$ and call a cell vicious if it contains a number distinct\n\n\n\nfrom $M$. We will prove that there are at least $H^{2}(m-1)+2 S H m$ vicious cells.\n\nFirstly, we introduce some terminology. As in the previous solution, we number rows and columns and we use the same notions of small and big indices and lines; so, an index is small if it is congruent to one of the numbers $1,2, \\ldots, S$ modulo $(S+H)$. The numbers $1,2, \\ldots, S+H$ will be known as residues. For two residues $i$ and $j$, we say that a cell is of type $(i, j)$ if the index of its row is congruent to $i$ and the index of its column to $j$ modulo $(S+H)$. The number of vicious cells of this type is denoted by $v_{i j}$.\n\nLet $s, s^{\\prime}$ be two variables ranging over small residues and let $h, h^{\\prime}$ be two variables ranging over big residues. A cell is said to be of class $A, B, C$, or $D$ if its type is of shape $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}\\right),(s, h),(h, s)$, or $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$, respectively. The numbers of vicious cells belonging to these classes are denoted in this order by $a, b, c$, and $d$. Observe that each cell belongs to exactly one class.\n\nClaim 1. We have\n\n$$\nm \\leq \\frac{a}{S^{2}}+\\frac{b+c}{2 S H}\n\\tag{1}\n$$\n\nProof. Consider an arbitrary small row $r$. Denote the numbers of vicious cells on $r$ belonging to the classes $A$ and $B$ by $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, respectively. As in the previous solution, we obtain that $\\alpha \\geq S$ or $\\beta \\geq H$. So in each case we have $\\frac{\\alpha}{S}+\\frac{\\beta}{H} \\geq 1$.\n\nPerforming this argument separately for each small row and adding up all the obtained inequalities, we get $\\frac{a}{S}+\\frac{b}{H} \\geq m S$. Interchanging rows and columns we similarly get $\\frac{a}{S}+\\frac{c}{H} \\geq m S$. Summing these inequalities and dividing by $2 S$ we get what we have claimed.\n\nClaim 2. Fix two small residue $s, s^{\\prime}$ and two big residues $h, h^{\\prime}$. Then $2 m-1 \\leq v_{s s^{\\prime}}+v_{s h^{\\prime}}+v_{h h^{\\prime}}$. Proof. Each napkin covers exactly one cell of type $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}\\right)$. Removing all napkins covering a vicious cell of this type, we get another collection of napkins, which covers each cell of type $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}\\right)$ either 0 or $M$ times depending on whether the cell is vicious or not. Hence $\\left(m^{2}-v_{s s^{\\prime}}\\right) M$ napkins are left and throughout the proof of Claim 2 we will consider only these remaining napkins. Now, using a red pen, write in each cell the number of napkins covering it. Notice that a cell containing a red number greater than $M$ is surely vicious.\n\nWe call two cells neighbors if they can be simultaneously covered by some napkin. So, each cell of type $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ has not more than four neighbors of type $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}\\right)$, while each cell of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ has not more than two neighbors of each of the types $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}\\right)$ and $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$. Therefore, each red number at a cell of type $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ does not exceed $4 M$, while each red number at a cell of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ does not exceed $2 M$.\n\nLet $x, y$, and $z$ be the numbers of cells of type $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ whose red number belongs to $(M, 2 M]$, $(2 M, 3 M]$, and $(3 M, 4 M]$, respectively. All these cells are vicious, hence $x+y+z \\leq v_{h h^{\\prime}}$. The red numbers appearing in cells of type $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ clearly sum up to $\\left(m^{2}-v_{s s^{\\prime}}\\right) M$. Bounding each of these numbers by a multiple of $M$ we get\n\n$$\n\\left(m^{2}-v_{s s^{\\prime}}\\right) M \\leq\\left((m-1)^{2}-(x+y+z)\\right) M+2 x M+3 y M+4 z M\n$$\n\n\n\ni.e.\n\n$$\n2 m-1 \\leq v_{s s^{\\prime}}+x+2 y+3 z \\leq v_{s s^{\\prime}}+v_{h h^{\\prime}}+y+2 z\n$$\n\nSo, to prove the claim it suffices to prove that $y+2 z \\leq v_{s h^{\\prime}}$.\n\nFor a cell $\\delta$ of type $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ and a cell $\\beta$ of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ we say that $\\delta$ forces $\\beta$ if there are more than $M$ napkins covering both of them. Since each red number in a cell of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ does not exceed $2 M$, it cannot be forced by more than one cell.\n\nOn the other hand, if a red number in a $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$-cell belongs to $(2 M, 3 M]$, then it forces at least one of its neighbors of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ (since the sum of red numbers in their cells is greater than $2 M)$. Analogously, an $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$-cell with the red number in $(3 M, 4 M]$ forces both its neighbors of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$, since their red numbers do not exceed $2 M$. Therefore there are at least $y+2 z$ forced cells and clearly all of them are vicious, as desired.\n\nClaim 3. We have\n\n$$\n2 m-1 \\leq \\frac{a}{S^{2}}+\\frac{b+c}{2 S H}+\\frac{d}{H^{2}}\n\\tag{2}\n$$\n\nProof.

Finally, the right parts of two of the flags $L_{1} R_{1}, L_{3} R_{3}, L_{4} R_{4}$ can also form a $2 \\times 2$ square with a blue diagonal by (ii). Putting these $2 \\times 2$ squares on the diagonal of a $4 \\times 4$ square, we find a desired arrangement of four flags.\n\nWe are ready to prove the problem statement by induction on $N$; actually, above we have proved the base case $N=4$.

Similarly, assign to each block a letter $\\mathrm{L}$ or $\\mathrm{R}$ if a king stands in its left or right half. So we define T-blocks, B-blocks, L-blocks, and $R$-blocks. We also combine the letters; we call a block $a T L$-block if it is simultaneously T-block and L-block. Similarly we define TR-blocks, $B L$-blocks, and BR-blocks. The arrangement of blocks determines uniquely the arrangement of kings; so in the rest of the solution we consider the $50 \\times 50$ system of blocks (see Fig. 1). We identify the blocks by their coordinate pairs; the pair $(i, j)$, where $1 \\leq i, j \\leq 50$, refers to the $j$ th block in the $i$ th row (or the $i$ th block in the $j$ th column).

Therefore, $(i+1, j)$ cannot be a TR-block (see Fig. 2), hence $(i+1, j)$ is a TL-block, thus the $(i+1)$ th row is an L-row. Now, choosing the $i$ th row to be the topmost L-row, we successively obtain that all rows from the $i$ th to the 50th are L-rows.

chessboard has rotational and reflection symmetries, we need to divide the total number of arrangements by the number of symmetries to avoid overcounting.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the number of symmetries\nThe 100x100 chessboard has 8 rotational symmetries (0, 90, 180, 270 degrees) and 8 reflection symmetries (horizontal and vertical reflections), for a total of 16 symmetries.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the final number of arrangements\nWe need to divide the total number of arrangements by the number of symmetries to get the final answer.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the final number of arrangements\nThe final number of arrangements is (100C25)^10 / 16.\n\n## Step 10: Simplify the expression\nWe can simplify the expression (100C25)^10 / 16 to get the final answer.\n\n## Step 11: Calculate the value of 100C25\n100C25 = 100! / (25! * (100-25)!) = 100! / (25! * 75!).\n\n## Step 12: Simplify the expression\nWe can simplify the expression 100! / (25! * 75!) to get a numerical value.\n\n## Step 13: Calculate the numerical value of 100C25\n100C25 = 1,165,520,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000"],

Suppose we are given a dissection as in the problem statement. A triangle in the dissection which is odd and isosceles will be called iso-odd for brevity.\n\nLemma. Let $A B$ be one of dissecting diagonals and let $\\mathcal{L}$ be the shorter part of the boundary of the 2006-gon with endpoints $A, B$. Suppose that $\\mathcal{L}$ consists of $n$ segments. Then the number of iso-odd triangles with vertices on $\\mathcal{L}$ does not exceed $n / 2$.\n\nProof. This is obvious for $n=2$. Take $n$ with $2<n \\leq 1003$ and assume the claim to be true for every $\\mathcal{L}$ of length less than $n$. Let now $\\mathcal{L}$ (endpoints $A, B$ ) consist of $n$ segments. Let $P Q$ be the longest diagonal which is a side of an iso-odd triangle $P Q S$ with all vertices on $\\mathcal{L}$ (if there is no such triangle, there is nothing to prove). Every triangle whose vertices lie on $\\mathcal{L}$ is obtuse or right-angled; thus $S$ is the summit of $P Q S$. We may assume that the five points $A, P, S, Q, B$ lie on $\\mathcal{L}$ in this order and partition $\\mathcal{L}$ into four pieces $\\mathcal{L}_{A P}, \\mathcal{L}_{P S}, \\mathcal{L}_{S Q}, \\mathcal{L}_{Q B}$ (the outer ones possibly reducing to a point).\n\nBy the definition of $P Q$, an iso-odd triangle cannot have vertices on both $\\mathcal{L}_{A P}$ and $\\mathcal{L}_{Q B}$. Therefore every iso-odd triangle within $\\mathcal{L}$ has all its vertices on just one of the four pieces. Applying to each of these pieces the induction hypothesis and adding the four inequalities we get that the number of iso-odd triangles within $\\mathcal{L}$ other than $P Q S$ does not exceed $n / 2$. And since each of $\\mathcal{L}_{P S}, \\mathcal{L}_{S Q}$ consists of an odd number of sides, the inequalities for these two pieces are actually strict, leaving a $1 / 2+1 / 2$ in excess. Hence the triangle $P S Q$ is also covered by the estimate $n / 2$. This concludes the induction step and proves the lemma.\n\nThe remaining part of the solution in fact repeats the argument from the above proof. Consider the longest dissecting diagonal $X Y$. Let $\\mathcal{L}_{X Y}$ be the shorter of the two parts of the boundary with endpoints $X, Y$ and let $X Y Z$ be the triangle in the dissection with vertex $Z$ not on $\\mathcal{L}_{X Y}$. Notice that $X Y Z$ is acute or right-angled, otherwise one of the segments $X Z, Y Z$ would be longer than $X Y$. Denoting by $\\mathcal{L}_{X Z}, \\mathcal{L}_{Y Z}$ the two pieces defined by $Z$ and applying the lemma to each of $\\mathcal{L}_{X Y}, \\mathcal{L}_{X Z}, \\mathcal{L}_{Y Z}$ we infer that there are no more than 2006/2 iso-odd triangles in all, unless $X Y Z$ is one of them. But in that case $X Z$ and $Y Z$ are odd diagonals and the corresponding inequalities are strict. This shows that also in this case the total number of iso-odd triangles in the dissection, including $X Y Z$, is not greater than 1003.\n\nThis bound can be achieved. For this to happen, it just suffices to select a vertex of the 2006-gon and draw a broken line joining every second vertex, starting from the selected one. Since 2006 is even, the line closes.

We say that these sides belong to the iso-odd triangle $A B C$.\n\nAt least one side in each of these groups does not belong to any other iso-odd triangle. This is so because any odd triangle whose vertices are among the points between $A$ and $B$ has two sides of equal length and therefore has an even number of sides belonging to it in total. Eliminating all sides belonging to any other iso-odd triangle in this area must therefore leave one side that belongs to no other iso-odd triangle. Let us assign these two sides (one in each group) to the triangle $A B C$.\n\nTo each iso-odd triangle we have thus assigned a pair of sides, with no two triangles sharing an assigned side.

The map $a \\mapsto a^{\\prime}$ is clearly injective, so the number of cubes $a$ we are interested in does not exceed $|(Y \\cap Z) \\backslash X|=n-1$.

Indeed, $X \\cap M_{2}$ contains at most $2 n-1$ cubes from $X \\cap Y$ or $X \\cap Z$. Any other cube $a$ in $X \\cap M_{2}$ corresponds to some $a^{\\prime} \\in Y \\cap Z$ (possibly with $a^{\\prime} \\in X$ ), so there are at most $n$ of them. All this results in $\\left|X \\cap M_{2}\\right| \\leqslant(2 n-1)+n=3 n-1$, which is even better than we need (by the assumptions of our case).\n\nSumming up the inequalities from the Claim over all $x$-boxes $X$, we obtain\n\n$$\n4 n_{1}+n_{2} \\leqslant n(3 n+1) .\n$$\n\nObviously, we also have $n_{1}+n_{2}+n_{3}=n^{3}$.\n\nNow we are prepared to estimate $C$.

We call a set of lattice points up-right closed if its points stay in the set after being shifted by any lattice vector $(i, j)$ with $i, j \\geqslant 0$.

This means that $\\mathcal{F}$ is the largest (with respect to inclusion) stable set within $\\mathcal{Q}$, and we are about to describe this set.\n\n2. A description of a final set.

Consider all the rays emerging at $O$ and passing through a point from $\\mathcal{K}_{n}$; number them as $r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{m}$ in increasing order according to slope. Let $A_{i}$ be the farthest from $O$ lattice point in $r_{i} \\cap \\mathcal{K}_{n}$, set $k_{i}=\\left|r_{i} \\cap \\mathcal{K}_{n}\\right|$, let $\\vec{v}_{i}=\\overrightarrow{O A_{i}}$, and finally denote $\\mathcal{V}=\\left\\{\\vec{v}_{i}: 1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant m\\right\\}$; see the Figure above to the right. We will concentrate on the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve $d_{0} d_{1} \\ldots d_{m}$; let $\\mathcal{D}$ be the set of all lattice points $p$ such that $p \\geqslant p^{\\prime}$ for some (not necessarily lattice) point $p^{\\prime}$ on the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve. In fact, we will show that $\\mathcal{D}=\\mathcal{F}$.\n\nClearly, the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve is symmetric in the line $y=x$. Denote by $D$ the convex hull of $\\mathcal{D}$.\n\n3. We prove that the set $\\mathcal{D}$ contains all stable sets. Let $\\mathcal{S} \\subset \\mathcal{Q}$ be a stable set (recall that it is assumed to be up-right closed and to have a finite complement in $\\mathcal{Q}$ ). Denote by $S$ its convex hull; clearly, the vertices of $S$ are lattice points. The boundary of $S$ consists of two rays (horizontal and vertical ones) along with some $\\mathcal{V}_{*}$-curve for some set of lattice vectors $\\mathcal{V}_{*}$.\n\nClaim 1. For every $\\vec{v}_{i} \\in \\mathcal{V}$, there is a $\\vec{v}_{i}^{*} \\in \\mathcal{V}_{*}$ co-directed with $\\vec{v}$ with $\\left|\\vec{v}_{i}^{*}\\right| \\geqslant|\\vec{v}|$.\n\nProof. Let $\\ell$ be the supporting line of $S$ parallel to $\\vec{v}_{i}$ (i.e., $\\ell$ contains some point of $S$, and the set $S$ lies on one side of $\\ell$ ). Take any point $b \\in \\ell \\cap \\mathcal{S}$ and consider $N(b)$. The line $\\ell$ splits the set $N(b) \\backslash \\ell$ into two congruent parts, one having an empty intersection with $\\mathcal{S}$. Hence, in order for $b$ not to be lonely, at least half of the set $\\ell \\cap N(b)$ (which contains $2 k_{i}$ points) should lie in $S$. Thus, the boundary of $S$ contains a segment $\\ell \\cap S$ with at least $k_{i}+1$ lattice points (including $b$ ) on it; this segment corresponds to the required vector $\\vec{v}_{i}^{*} \\in \\mathcal{V}_{*}$.\n\n<img_3156>\n\nProof of Claim 1\n\n<img_3490>\n\nProof of Claim 2\n\nClaim 2. Each stable set $\\mathcal{S} \\subseteq \\mathcal{Q}$ lies in $\\mathcal{D}$.\n\nProof. To show this, it suffices to prove that the $\\mathcal{V}_{*}$-curve lies in $D$, i.e., that all its vertices do so. Let $p^{\\prime}$ be an arbitrary vertex of the $\\mathcal{V}_{*}$-curve; $p^{\\prime}$ partitions this curve into two parts, $\\mathcal{X}$ (being down-right of $p$ ) and $\\mathcal{Y}$ (being up-left of $p$ ). The set $\\mathcal{V}$ is split now into two parts: $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{X}}$ consisting of those $\\vec{v}_{i} \\in \\mathcal{V}$ for which $\\vec{v}_{i}^{*}$ corresponds to a segment in $\\mathcal{X}$, and a similar part $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{Y}}$. Notice that the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve consists of several segments corresponding to $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{X}}$, followed by those corresponding to $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{Y}}$. Hence there is a vertex $p$ of the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve separating $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{X}}$ from $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{Y}}$. Claim 1 now yields that $p^{\\prime} \\geqslant p$, so $p^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{D}$, as required.\n\nClaim 2 implies that the final set $\\mathcal{F}$ is contained in $\\mathcal{D}$.\n\n4. $\\mathcal{D}$ is stable, and its comfortable points are known. Recall the definitions of $r_{i}$; let $r_{i}^{\\prime}$ be the ray complementary to $r_{i}$. By our definitions, the set $N(O)$ contains no points between the rays $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$, as well as between $r_{i}^{\\prime}$ and $r_{i+1}^{\\prime}$.\n\nClaim 3. In the set $\\mathcal{D}$, all lattice points of the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve are comfortable.\n\nProof. Let $p$ be any lattice point of the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve, belonging to some segment $d_{i} d_{i+1}$. Draw the line $\\ell$ containing this segment. Then $\\ell \\cap \\mathcal{D}$ contains exactly $k_{i}+1$ lattice points, all of which lie in $N(p)$ except for $p$. Thus, exactly half of the points in $N(p) \\cap \\ell$ lie in $\\mathcal{D}$. It remains to show that all points of $N(p)$ above $\\ell$ lie in $\\mathcal{D}$ (recall that all the points below $\\ell$ lack this property).\n\n\n\nNotice that each vector in $\\mathcal{V}$ has one coordinate greater than $n / 2$; thus the neighborhood of $p$ contains parts of at most two segments of the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve succeeding $d_{i} d_{i+1}$, as well as at most two of those preceding it.\n\nThe angles formed by these consecutive segments are obtained from those formed by $r_{j}$ and $r_{j-1}^{\\prime}$ (with $i-1 \\leqslant j \\leqslant i+2$ ) by shifts; see the Figure below. All the points in $N(p)$ above $\\ell$ which could lie outside $\\mathcal{D}$ lie in shifted angles between $r_{j}, r_{j+1}$ or $r_{j}^{\\prime}, r_{j-1}^{\\prime}$. But those angles, restricted to $N(p)$, have no lattice points due to the above remark. The claim is proved.\n<img_3487>\n\nProof of Claim 3\n\nClaim 4. All the points of $\\mathcal{D}$ which are not on the boundary of $D$ are crowded.\n\nProof. Let $p \\in \\mathcal{D}$ be such a point. If it is to the up-right of some point $p^{\\prime}$ on the curve, then the claim is easy: the shift of $N\\left(p^{\\prime}\\right) \\cap \\mathcal{D}$ by $\\overrightarrow{p^{\\prime} p}$ is still in $\\mathcal{D}$, and $N(p)$ contains at least one more point of $\\mathcal{D}$ - either below or to the left of $p$. So, we may assume that $p$ lies in a right triangle constructed on some hypothenuse $d_{i} d_{i+1}$. Notice here that $d_{i}, d_{i+1} \\in N(p)$.\n\nDraw a line $\\ell \\| d_{i} d_{i+1}$ through $p$, and draw a vertical line $h$ through $d_{i}$; see Figure below. Let $\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{L}}$ and $\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{R}}$ be the parts of $\\mathcal{D}$ lying to the left and to the right of $h$, respectively (points of $\\mathcal{D} \\cap h$ lie in both parts).\n\n<img_3424>\n\nNotice that the vectors $\\overrightarrow{d_{i} p}, \\overrightarrow{d_{i+1} d_{i+2}}, \\overrightarrow{d_{i} d_{i+1}}, \\overrightarrow{d_{i-1} d_{i}}$, and $\\overrightarrow{p d_{i+1}}$ are arranged in non-increasing order by slope. This means that $\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{L}}$ shifted by $\\overrightarrow{d_{i} p}$ still lies in $\\mathcal{D}$, as well as $\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{R}}$ shifted by $\\overrightarrow{d_{i+1} p}$. As we have seen in the proof of Claim 3, these two shifts cover all points of $N(p)$ above $\\ell$, along with those on $\\ell$ to the left of $p$. Since $N(p)$ contains also $d_{i}$ and $d_{i+1}$, the point $p$ is crowded.\n\nThus, we have proved that $\\mathcal{D}=\\mathcal{F}$, and have shown that the lattice points on the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve are exactly the comfortable points of $\\mathcal{D}$. It remains to find their number.\n\nRecall the definition of $\\mathcal{K}_{n}$ (see Figure on the first page of the solution). Each segment $d_{i} d_{i+1}$ contains $k_{i}$ lattice points different from $d_{i}$. Taken over all $i$, these points exhaust all the lattice points in the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve, except for $d_{1}$, and thus the number of lattice points on the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve is $1+\\sum_{i=1}^{m} k_{i}$. On the other hand, $\\sum_{i=1}^{m} k_{i}$ is just the number of points in $\\mathcal{K}_{n}$, so it equals $n^{2}$.

Each butterfly is classified as lonely, crowded, or comfortable based on the number of butterflies in its neighborhood, which is a $(2n+1) \\times (2n+1)$ square centered at the butterfly. A butterfly is lonely if it has fewer than half the number of butterflies in its neighborhood, crowded if it has more, and comfortable if it has exactly half. The process involves butterflies flying away if they are lonely, and this continues until there are no more lonely butterflies.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the number of lattice points in the neighborhood\nThe neighborhood of a lattice point $c$ consists of all lattice points within the $(2n+1) \\times (2n+1)$ square centered at $c$, apart from $c$ itself.

At this point, all remaining butterflies are either crowded or comfortable.\n\n## Step 9: Determine the number of comfortable butterflies at the final state\nSince the number of butterflies in a comfortable neighborhood is exactly half the number of lattice points in the neighborhood, and the number of lattice points in the neighborhood is $4n^2 + 4n + 1$, the number of comfortable butterflies at the final state is $\\frac{4n^2 + 4n + 1}{2}$.\n\n## Step 10: Simplify the expression for the number of comfortable butterflies\nThe expression $\\frac{4n^2 + 4n + 1}{2}$ can be simplified to $2n^2 + 2n + \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n## Step 11: Consider the parity of n\nSince n is a positive integer, the expression $2n^2 + 2n + \\frac{1}{2}$ will always be an integer if n is even, but will be a non-integer if n is odd.\n\n## Step 12: Determine the final answer\nSince the problem asks for the number of comfortable butterflies at the final state, and the expression $2n^2 + 2n + \\frac{1}{2}$ is not an integer when n is odd, we must consider the case when n is even.\n\n## Step 13: Consider the case when n is even\nWhen n is even, the expression $2n^2 + 2n + \\frac{1}{2}$ simplifies to $2n^2 + 2n + \\frac{1}{2} = 2(n^2 + n) + \\frac{1}{2}$.

A tangent segment is a line segment that is a common tangent to two circles, starting at one tangent point and ending at the other one. Luciano is drawing tangent segments on the blackboard, one at a time, so that no tangent segment intersects any other circles or previously drawn tangent segments. Luciano keeps drawing tangent segments until no more can be drawn. Find all possible numbers of tangent segments when he stops drawing.", "gt_cot": "None", "gt": "6048", "unit": null, "solution": ["First, consider a particular arrangement of circles $C_{1}, C_{2}, \\ldots, C_{n}$ where all the centers are aligned and each $C_{i}$ is eclipsed from the other circles by its neighbors - for example, taking $C_{i}$ with center $\\left(i^{2}, 0\\right)$ and radius $i / 2$ works. Then the only tangent segments that can be drawn are between adjacent circles $C_{i}$ and $C_{i+1}$, and exactly three segments can be drawn for each pair. So Luciano will draw exactly $3(n-1)$ segments in this case.\n\n<img_3497>\n\nFor the general case, start from a final configuration (that is, an arrangement of circles and segments in which no further segments can be drawn). The idea of the solution is to continuously resize and move the circles around the plane, one by one (in particular, making sure we never have 4 circles with a common tangent line), and show that the number of segments drawn remains constant as the picture changes. This way, we can reduce any circle/segment configuration to the particular one mentioned above, and the final number of segments must remain at $3 n-3$.\n\nSome preliminary considerations: look at all possible tangent segments joining any two circles. A segment that is tangent to a circle $A$ can do so in two possible orientations - it may come out of $A$ in clockwise or counterclockwise orientation. Two segments touching the same circle with the same orientation will never intersect each other. Each pair $(A, B)$ of circles has 4 choices of tangent segments, which can be identified by their orientations - for example, $(A+, B-)$ would be the segment which comes out of $A$ in clockwise orientation and comes out of $B$ in counterclockwise orientation. In total, we have $2 n(n-1)$ possible segments, disregarding intersections.\n\nNow we pick a circle $C$ and start to continuously move and resize it, maintaining all existing tangent segments according to their identifications, including those involving $C$. We can keep our choice of tangent segments until the configuration reaches a transition. We lose nothing if we assume that $C$ is kept at least $\\varepsilon$ units away from any other circle, where $\\varepsilon$ is a positive, fixed constant; therefore at a transition either: (1) a currently drawn tangent segment $t$ suddenly becomes obstructed; or (2) a currently absent tangent segment $t$ suddenly becomes unobstructed and available.\n\nClaim. A transition can only occur when three circles $C_{1}, C_{2}, C_{3}$ are tangent to a common line $\\ell$ containing $t$, in a way such that the three tangent segments lying on $\\ell$ (joining the three circles pairwise) are not obstructed by any other circles or tangent segments (other than $C_{1}, C_{2}, C_{3}$ ). Proof. Since (2) is effectively the reverse of (1), it suffices to prove the claim for (1). Suppose $t$ has suddenly become obstructed, and let us consider two cases.\n\n\n\nCase 1: $t$ becomes obstructed by a circle\n\n<img_3256>\n\nThen the new circle becomes the third circle tangent to $\\ell$, and no other circles or tangent segments are obstructing $t$.\n\nCase 2: $t$ becomes obstructed by another tangent segment $t^{\\prime}$ \n\nWhen two segments $t$ and $t^{\\prime}$ first intersect each other, they must do so at a vertex of one of them. But if a vertex of $t^{\\prime}$ first crossed an interior point of $t$, the circle associated to this vertex was already blocking $t$ (absurd), or is about to (we already took care of this in case 1). So we only have to analyze the possibility of $t$ and $t^{\\prime}$ suddenly having a common vertex. However, if that happens, this vertex must belong to a single circle (remember we are keeping different circles at least $\\varepsilon$ units apart from each other throughout the moving/resizing process), and therefore they must have different orientations with respect to that circle.\n<img_4010>\n\nThus, at the transition moment, both $t$ and $t^{\\prime}$ are tangent to the same circle at a common point, that is, they must be on the same line $\\ell$ and hence we again have three circles simultaneously tangent to $\\ell$. Also no other circles or tangent segments are obstructing $t$ or $t^{\\prime}$ (otherwise, they would have disappeared before this transition).\n\nNext, we focus on the maximality of a configuration immediately before and after a transition, where three circles share a common tangent line $\\ell$. Let the three circles be $C_{1}, C_{2}, C_{3}$, ordered by their tangent points. The only possibly affected segments are the ones lying on $\\ell$, namely $t_{12}, t_{23}$ and $t_{13}$. Since $C_{2}$ is in the middle, $t_{12}$ and $t_{23}$ must have different orientations with respect to $C_{2}$. For $C_{1}, t_{12}$ and $t_{13}$ must have the same orientation, while for $C_{3}, t_{13}$ and $t_{23}$ must have the same orientation. The figure below summarizes the situation, showing alternative positions for $C_{1}$ (namely, $C_{1}$ and $C_{1}^{\\prime}$ ) and for $C_{3}\\left(C_{3}\\right.$ and $C_{3}^{\\prime}$ ).\n\n<img_3756>\n\n\n\nNow perturb the diagram slightly so the three circles no longer have a common tangent, while preserving the definition of $t_{12}, t_{23}$ and $t_{13}$ according to their identifications. First note that no other circles or tangent segments can obstruct any of these segments. Also recall that tangent segments joining the same circle at the same orientation will never obstruct each other.\n\nThe availability of the tangent segments can now be checked using simple diagrams.\n\nCase 1: $t_{13}$ passes through $C_{2}$\n\n<img_3220>\n\nIn this case, $t_{13}$ is not available, but both $t_{12}$ and $t_{23}$ are.\n\nCase 2: $t_{13}$ does not pass through $C_{2}$\n\n<img_3461>\n\nNow $t_{13}$ is available, but $t_{12}$ and $t_{23}$ obstruct each other, so only one can be drawn.\n\nIn any case, exactly 2 out of these 3 segments can be drawn. Thus the maximal number of segments remains constant as we move or resize the circles, and we are done.", "First note that all tangent segments lying on the boundary of the convex hull of the circles are always drawn since they do not intersect anything else. Now in the final picture, aside from the $n$ circles, the blackboard is divided into regions. We can consider the picture as a plane (multi-)graph $G$ in which the circles are the vertices and the tangent segments are the edges. The idea of this solution is to find a relation between the number of edges and the number of regions in $G$; then, once we prove that $G$ is connected, we can use Euler's formula to finish the problem.\n\nThe boundary of each region consists of 1 or more (for now) simple closed curves, each made of arcs and tangent segments. The segment and the arc might meet smoothly (as in $S_{i}$, $i=1,2, \\ldots, 6$ in the figure below) or not (as in $P_{1}, P_{2}, P_{3}, P_{4}$; call such points sharp corners of the boundary). In other words, if a person walks along the border, her direction would suddenly turn an angle of $\\pi$ at a sharp corner.\n\n\n\n<img_3559>\n\nClaim 1. The outer boundary $B_{1}$ of any internal region has at least 3 sharp corners.\n\nProof. Let a person walk one lap along $B_{1}$ in the counterclockwise orientation. As she does so, she will turn clockwise as she moves along the circle arcs, and not turn at all when moving along the lines. On the other hand, her total rotation after one lap is $2 \\pi$ in the counterclockwise direction! Where could she be turning counterclockwise? She can only do so at sharp corners, and, even then, she turns only an angle of $\\pi$ there. But two sharp corners are not enough, since at least one arc must be present - so she must have gone through at least 3 sharp corners.\n\nClaim 2. Each internal region is simply connected, that is, has only one boundary curve.\n\nProof. Suppose, by contradiction, that some region has an outer boundary $B_{1}$ and inner boundaries $B_{2}, B_{3}, \\ldots, B_{m}(m \\geqslant 2)$. Let $P_{1}$ be one of the sharp corners of $B_{1}$.\n\nNow consider a car starting at $P_{1}$ and traveling counterclockwise along $B_{1}$. It starts in reverse, i.e., it is initially facing the corner $P_{1}$. Due to the tangent conditions, the car may travel in a way so that its orientation only changes when it is moving along an arc. In particular, this means the car will sometimes travel forward. For example, if the car approaches a sharp corner when driving in reverse, it would continue travel forward after the corner, instead of making an immediate half-turn. This way, the orientation of the car only changes in a clockwise direction since the car always travels clockwise around each arc.\n\nNow imagine there is a laser pointer at the front of the car, pointing directly ahead. Initially, the laser endpoint hits $P_{1}$, but, as soon as the car hits an arc, the endpoint moves clockwise around $B_{1}$. In fact, the laser endpoint must move continuously along $B_{1}$ ! Indeed, if the endpoint ever jumped (within $B_{1}$, or from $B_{1}$ to one of the inner boundaries), at the moment of the jump the interrupted laser would be a drawable tangent segment that Luciano missed (see figure below for an example).\n\n<img_3484>\n\n\n\nNow, let $P_{2}$ and $P_{3}$ be the next two sharp corners the car goes through, after $P_{1}$ (the previous lemma assures their existence). At $P_{2}$ the car starts moving forward, and at $P_{3}$ it will start to move in reverse again. So, at $P_{3}$, the laser endpoint is at $P_{3}$ itself. So while the car moved counterclockwise between $P_{1}$ and $P_{3}$, the laser endpoint moved clockwise between $P_{1}$ and $P_{3}$. That means the laser beam itself scanned the whole region within $B_{1}$, and it should have crossed some of the inner boundaries.\n\nClaim 3. Each region has exactly 3 sharp corners.\n\nProof. Consider again the car of the previous claim, with its laser still firmly attached to its front, traveling the same way as before and going through the same consecutive sharp corners $P_{1}, P_{2}$ and $P_{3}$. As we have seen, as the car goes counterclockwise from $P_{1}$ to $P_{3}$, the laser endpoint goes clockwise from $P_{1}$ to $P_{3}$, so together they cover the whole boundary. If there were a fourth sharp corner $P_{4}$, at some moment the laser endpoint would pass through it. But, since $P_{4}$ is a sharp corner, this means the car must be on the extension of a tangent segment going through $P_{4}$. Since the car is not on that segment itself (the car never goes through $P_{4}$ ), we would have 3 circles with a common tangent line, which is not allowed.\n\n<img_3207>\n\nWe are now ready to finish the solution. Let $r$ be the number of internal regions, and $s$ be the number of tangent segments. Since each tangent segment contributes exactly 2 sharp corners to the diagram, and each region has exactly 3 sharp corners, we must have $2 s=3 r$. Since the graph corresponding to the diagram is connected, we can use Euler's formula $n-s+r=1$ and find $s=3 n-3$ and $r=2 n-2$."], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Geometry", "code": ["## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are given 2017 mutually external circles drawn on a blackboard, and Luciano is drawing tangent segments one at a time, such that no tangent segment intersects any other circles or previously drawn tangent segments.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the key to the problem\nThe key to this problem is to understand that each new tangent segment drawn can connect two circles that have not been connected before, and that no three circles can share a common tangent.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the initial number of tangent segments\nSince there are 2017 circles, the initial number of tangent segments is 0, as no tangent segments have been drawn yet.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the pattern of tangent segments\nWhen Luciano draws the first tangent segment, it connects two circles, creating 1 new tangent segment.

We claim that the required partition exists and is unique. The two diagonals of the board divide the board into four regions. Note that the domino covering cell $(1,1)$ must be vertical. This in turn shows that each domino covering $(2,2),(3,3), \\ldots,(n, n)$ is vertical. By induction, the dominoes in the left region are all vertical. By rotational symmetry, the dominoes in the bottom region are horizontal, and so on. This shows that the partition exists and is unique.\n<img_3889>\n\nIt remains to show that this value of $k$ is the smallest possible. Assume that only $k<2 n$ cells are marked, and there exists a partition $P$ satisfying the requirement. It suffices to show there exists another desirable partition distinct from $P$. Let $d$ be the main diagonal of the board.\n\nConstruct the following graph with edges of two colours. Its vertices are the cells of the board. Connect two vertices with a red edge if they belong to the same domino of $P$. Connect two vertices with a blue edge if their reflections in $d$ are connected by a red edge. It is possible that two vertices are connected by edges of both colours. Clearly, each vertex has both red and blue degrees equal to 1 . Thus the graph splits into cycles where the colours of edges in each cycle alternate (a cycle may have length 2).\n\nConsider any cell $c$ lying on the diagonal $d$. Its two edges are symmetrical with respect to $d$. Thus they connect $c$ to different cells. This shows $c$ belongs to a cycle $C(c)$ of length at least 4. Consider a part of this cycle $c_{0}, c_{1}, \\ldots, c_{m}$ where $c_{0}=c$ and $m$ is the least positive integer such that $c_{m}$ lies on $d$. Clearly, $c_{m}$ is distinct from $c$. From the construction, the path symmetrical to this with respect to $d$ also lies in the graph, and so these paths together form $C(c)$. Hence, $C(c)$ contains exactly two cells from $d$. Then all $2 n$ cells in $d$ belong to $n$ cycles $C_{1}, C_{2}, \\ldots, C_{n}$, each has length at least 4.\n\nBy the Pigeonhole Principle, there exists a cycle $C_{i}$ containing at most one of the $k$ marked cells.

Then we put the dominoes corresponding to the blue edges of $C_{i}$. Since $C_{i}$ has at least 4 vertices, the resultant partition $P^{\\prime}$ is different from $P$.

This implies that the product of all elements in the set must be divisible by a number greater than 1.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the function P(n)\nThe function $P(n) = n^2 + n + 1$ can be factored as $P(n) = (n+1)(n+2) - 1$. This means that for any two consecutive values of $n$, the corresponding values of $P(n)$ will have a difference of 1.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the smallest possible fragrant set\nTo find the smallest possible fragrant set, we need to find the smallest value of $b$ such that the set $\\{P(a), P(a+1), P(a+2), \\ldots, P(a+b)\\}$ is fragrant.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the product of consecutive P(n) values\nSince $P(n) = (n+1)(n+2) - 1$, the product of two consecutive $P(n)$ values will be $(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)(n+4) - 2(n+1)(n+2) + 1$.

At any round, while possible, A chooses two equal nonzero numbers on the board. Clearly, while $A$ can make such choice, the game does not terminate. On the other hand, $A$ can follow this strategy unless the game has already terminated. Indeed, if $A$ always chooses two equal numbers, then each number appearing on the board is either 0 or a power of 2 with non-negative integer exponent, this can be easily proved using induction on the number of rounds. At the moment when $A$ is unable to follow the strategy all nonzero numbers on the board are distinct powers of 2 . If the board contains at least one such power, then the largest of those powers is greater than the sum of the others. Otherwise there are only zeros on the blackboard, in both cases the game terminates.\n\nFor every number on the board, define its range to be the number of ones it is obtained from. We can prove by induction on the number of rounds that for any nonzero number $k$ written by $B$ its range is $k$, and for any zero written by $B$ its range is a power of 2 . Thus at the end of each round all the ranges are powers of two, and their sum is $n$. Since $S_{2}(a+b) \\leqslant S_{2}(a)+S_{2}(b)$ for any positive integers $a$ and $b$, the number $n$ cannot be represented as a sum of less than $S_{2}(n)$ powers of 2 .

We intend to show that in this case $B$ will not lose more than $S_{2}(n)$ cookies. For this purpose, we prove several lemmas.\n\nFor a positive integer $k$, denote by $\\nu_{2}(k)$ the exponent of the largest power of 2 that divides $k$. Recall that, by Legendre's formula, $\\nu_{2}(n !)=n-S_{2}(n)$ for every positive integer $n$.\n\n\n\nLemma 1. The initial situation is good.\n\nProof. In the initial configuration, the number of balanced collections is equal to $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n \\\\ n / 2\\end{array}\\right)$. We have\n\n$$\n\\nu_{2}\\left(\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\nn \\\\\nn / 2\n\\end{array}\\right)\\right)=\\nu_{2}(n !)-2 \\nu_{2}((n / 2) !)=\\left(n-S_{2}(n)\\right)-2\\left(\\frac{n}{2}-S_{2}(n / 2)\\right)=S_{2}(n)=s\n$$\n\nHence $2^{s+1}$ does not divide the number of balanced collections, as desired.\n\nLemma 2. B may play so that after each round the situation remains good.\n\nProof. Assume that the situation $\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{k}\\right)$ before a round is good, and that $A$ erases two numbers, $x_{p}$ and $x_{q}$.\n\nLet $N$ be the number of all balanced collections, $N_{+}$be the number of those having $\\varepsilon_{p}=\\varepsilon_{q}$, and $N_{-}$be the number of other balanced collections. Then $N=N_{+}+N_{-}$. Now, if $B$ replaces $x_{p}$ and $x_{q}$ by $x_{p}+x_{q}$, then the number of balanced collections will become $N_{+}$. If $B$ replaces $x_{p}$ and $x_{q}$ by $\\left|x_{p}-x_{q}\\right|$, then this number will become $N_{-}$. Since $2^{s+1}$ does not divide $N$, it does not divide one of the summands $N_{+}$and $N_{-}$, hence $B$ can reach a good situation after the round.\n\nLemma 3. Assume that the game terminates at a good situation. Then the board contains at most $s$ numbers.\n\nProof. Suppose, one of the numbers is greater than the sum of the other numbers. Then the number of balanced collections is 0 and hence divisible by $2^{s+1}$. Therefore, the situation is not good.\n\nThen we have only zeros on the blackboard at the moment when the game terminates. If there are $k$ of them, then the number of balanced collections is $2^{k}$. Since the situation is good, we have $k \\leqslant s$.\n\nBy Lemmas 1 and 2, $B$ may act in such way that they keep the situation good.

Similarly, $a$ consecutive moves to the previous coin are followed by at least $a+1$ consecutive moves to\n\n\n\nthe next coin. There cannot be more than $n$ consecutive moves in the same direction, so this proves that the process terminates (with a move from the first coin to the position before the first coin).\n\nThus we have a (possibly empty) sequence $a_{1}<\\cdots<a_{t} \\leqslant n$ giving the lengths of maximal sequences of consecutive moves in the same direction, where the final $a_{t}$ moves must be moves to the previous coin, ending before the first coin. We claim there is a bijection between initial configurations of the coins and such sequences. This gives\n\n$$\nE(n)=\\frac{1}{2}(1+2+\\cdots+n)=\\frac{n(n+1)}{4}\n$$\n\nas required, since each $i$ with $1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n$ will appear in half of the sequences, and will contribute $i$ to the number of moves when it does.\n\nTo see the bijection, consider following the sequence of moves backwards, starting with the machine just before the first coin and all coins showing tails. This certainly determines a unique configuration of coins that could possibly correspond to the given sequence. Furthermore, every coin flipped as part of the $a_{j}$ consecutive moves is also flipped as part of all subsequent sequences of $a_{k}$ consecutive moves, for all $k>j$, meaning that, as we follow the moves backwards, each coin is always in the correct state when flipped to result in a move in the required direction. (Alternatively, since there are $2^{n}$ possible configurations of coins and $2^{n}$ possible such ascending sequences, the fact that the sequence of moves determines at most one configuration of coins, and thus that there is an injection from configurations of coins to such ascending sequences, is sufficient for it to be a bijection, without needing to show that coins are in the right state as we move backwards.)", "We explicitly describe what happens with an arbitrary sequence $C$ of $n$ coins. Suppose that $C$ contain $k$ heads at positions $1 \\leqslant c_{1}<c_{2}<\\cdots<c_{k} \\leqslant n$.\n\nLet $i$ be the minimal index such that $c_{i} \\geqslant k$.

After that we get a configuration with $k-1$ heads at the same positions as in the initial one, except for $c_{i}$. This part of the process takes $2\\left(c_{i}-k\\right)+1$ steps.\n\nAfter that, the process acts similarly; by induction on the number of heads we deduce that the process ends.

We need to find the average number of steps needed before all coins show tails.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the possible values of $\\ell(C)$\nWe can start by analyzing the possible values of $\\ell(C)$. If the initial configuration $C$ has no heads, then $\\ell(C) = 0$. If $C$ has one head, then $\\ell(C) = 1$. If $C$ has two heads, then $\\ell(C) = 2$.

This is because when we flip the $k^{\\text {th }}$ coin, it will change from heads to tails, and the $(k-1)^{\\text {th }}$ coin will change from tails to heads. This process will continue until we reach the configuration with two heads.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the number of steps for $k>2$\nSince we need to get to the configuration with two heads, the number of steps for $k>2$ is equal to the number of steps needed to get from the configuration with $k$ heads to the configuration with two heads. This is equal to $k-1$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the average value of $\\ell(C)$\nWe can calculate the average value of $\\ell(C)$ by considering the possible values of $\\ell(C)$ and their probabilities. The probability of having $k$ heads is $\\binom{n}{k} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2^n}$, and the average value of $\\ell(C)$ for $k>2$ is $k-1$.

At each such intersection, there is a two-way door connecting the two diagonally opposite corners at which sides of different colours meet.\n\nAfter Merlin paints the walls, Morgana then places some knights in the labyrinth.

When placing the $n^{\\text {th }}$ wall, it intersects each of the $n-1$ other walls exactly once and hence splits each of $n$ of the regions formed by those other walls into two regions. By the induction hypothesis, this yields $\\left(\\left(\\begin{array}{l}n \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)+1\\right)+n=\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+1 \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)+1$ regions, proving the claim.\n\nNow let $G$ be the graph with vertices given by the $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+1 \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)+1$ regions, and with two regions connected by an edge if there is a door between them.\n\nWe now show that no matter how Merlin paints the $n$ walls, Morgana can place at least $n+1$ knights. No matter how the walls are painted, there are exactly $\\left(\\begin{array}{l}n \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)$ intersection points, each of which corresponds to a single edge in $G$. Consider adding the edges of $G$ sequentially and note that each edge reduces the number of connected components by at most one.

If Morgana places a knight in regions corresponding to different connected components of $G$, then no two knights can ever meet.\n\nNow we give a construction showing that, no matter what shape the labyrinth is, Merlin can colour it such that there are exactly $n+1$ connected components, allowing Morgana to place at most $n+1$ knights.\n\nFirst, we choose a coordinate system on the labyrinth so that none of the walls run due north-south, or due east-west. We then have Merlin paint the west face of each wall red, and the east face of each wall blue. We label the regions according to how many walls the region is on the east side of: the labels are integers between 0 and $n$.\n\nWe claim that, for each $i$, the regions labelled $i$ are connected by doors. First, we note that for each $i$ with $0 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n$ there is a unique region labelled $i$ which is unbounded to the north.\n\nNow, consider a knight placed in some region with label $i$, and ask them to walk north (moving east or west by following the walls on the northern sides of regions, as needed). This knight will never get stuck: each region is convex, and so, if it is bounded to the north, it has a single northernmost vertex with a door northwards to another region with label $i$.\n\nEventually it will reach a region which is unbounded to the north, which will be the unique such region with label $i$. Hence every region with label $i$ is connected to this particular region, and so all regions with label $i$ are connected to each other.\n\nAs a result, there are exactly $n+1$ connected components, and Morgana can place at most $n+1$ knights.", "We give another description of a strategy for Merlin to paint the walls so that Morgana can place no more than $n+1$ knights.\n\nMerlin starts by building a labyrinth of $n$ walls of his own design. He places walls in turn with increasing positive gradients, placing each so far to the right that all intersection points of previously-placed lines lie to the left of it. He paints each in such a way that blue is on the left and red is on the right.\n\nFor example, here is a possible sequence of four such lines $\\ell_{1}, \\ell_{2}, \\ell_{3}, \\ell_{4}$ :\n\n<img_3427>\n\nWe say that a region is \"on the right\" if it has $x$-coordinate unbounded above (note that if we only have one wall, then both regions are on the right). We claim inductively that, after placing $n$ lines, there are $n+1$ connected components in the resulting labyrinth, each of which contains exactly one region on the right. This is certainly true after placing 0 lines, as then there is only one region (and hence one connected component) and it is on the right.\n\nWhen placing the $n^{\\text {th }}$ line, it then cuts every one of the $n-1$ previously placed lines, and since it is to the right of all intersection points, the regions it cuts are exactly the $n$ regions on the right.\n\n<img_3985>\n\nThe addition of this line leaves all previous connected components with exactly one region on the right, and creates a new connected component containing exactly one region, and that region is also on the right. As a result, by induction, this particular labyrinth will have $n+1$ connected components.\n\nHaving built this labyrinth, Merlin then moves the walls one-by-one (by a sequence of continuous translations and rotations of lines) into the proper position of the given labyrinth, in such a way that no two lines ever become parallel.\n\n\n\nThe only time the configuration is changed is when one wall is moved through an intersection point of two others:\n<img_3360>\n\nNote that all moves really do switch between two configurations like this: all sets of three lines have this colour configuration initially, and the rules on rotations mean they are preserved (in particular, we cannot create three lines creating a triangle with three red edges inwards, or three blue edges inwards).\n\nHowever, as can be seen, such a move preserves the number of connected components, so in the painting this provides for Arthur's actual labyrinth, Morgana can still only place at most $n+1$ knights."], "answer_type": "Expression", "subfield": "Combinatorics", "code": ["## Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem asks us to find the largest number of knights, denoted as $k(\\mathfrak{L})$, that can be placed in a labyrinth $\\mathfrak{L}$ with $n$ walls such that no two knights can ever meet, regardless of how Merlin paints the labyrinth.\n\n## Step 2: Consider the minimum number of walls\nWe start by considering the minimum number of walls, which is 1.

The following observation is also useful to simplify the analysis of strategies for Bob.\n\nObservation A. Consider two consecutive rounds. Suppose that in the first round Bob made a $k$-move and Alice picked the left group, and then in the second round Bob makes an $\\ell$-move, with $\\ell>k$. We may then assume, without loss of generality, that Alice again picks the left group.\n\nProof. Suppose Alice picks the right group in the second round. Then the combined effect of the two rounds is that each of the boxes $B_{k+1}, \\ldots, B_{\\ell}$ lost two pebbles (and the other boxes are unchanged). Hence this configuration is strictly dominated by that before the first round, and it suffices to consider only Alice's other response.\n\nFor Alice. Alice initially distributes pebbles according to $V_{\\left\\lceil\\frac{N}{2}\\right\\rceil}$. Suppose the current configuration of pebbles dominates $V_{i}$. If Bob makes a $k$-move with $k \\geqslant i$ then Alice picks the left group, which results in a configuration that dominates $V_{i+1}$. Likewise, if Bob makes a $k$-move with $k<i$ then Alice picks the right group, which results in a configuration that dominates $V_{i-1}$. Since none of $V_{1}, \\ldots, V_{N}$ contains an empty box, Alice can prevent Bob from ever winning.\n\nFor Bob. The key idea in this solution is the following claim.\n\nClaim. If there exist a positive integer $k$ such that there are at least $2 k$ boxes that have at most $k$ pebbles each then Bob can force a win.\n\nProof. We ignore the other boxes. First, Bob makes a $k$-move (splits the $2 k$ boxes into two groups of $k$ boxes each). Without loss of generality, Alice picks the left group. Then Bob makes a $(k+1)$-move, ... a $(2 k-1)$-move. By Observation A, we may suppose Alice always picks the left group. After Bob's $(2 k-1)$-move, the rightmost box becomes empty and Bob wins.\n\nNow, we claim that if $n<M$ then either there already exists an empty box, or there exist a positive integer $k$ and $2 k$ boxes with at most $k$ pebbles each (and thus Bob can force a win). Otherwise, assume each box contains at least 1 pebble, and for each $1 \\leqslant k \\leqslant\\left\\lfloor\\frac{N}{2}\\right\\rfloor$, at least $N-(2 k-1)=N+1-2 k$ boxes contain at least $k+1$ pebbles.

Say that one configuration dominates another if it has at least as many pebbles in each box, and say that it strictly dominates the other configuration if it also has more pebbles in at least one box.

The following observation is also useful to simplify the analysis of strategies for Bob.\n\nObservation A. Consider two consecutive rounds. Suppose that in the first round Bob made a $k$-move and Alice picked the left group, and then in the second round Bob makes an $\\ell$-move, with $\\ell>k$. We may then assume, without loss of generality, that Alice again picks the left group.\n\nProof. Suppose Alice picks the right group in the second round. Then the combined effect of the two rounds is that each of the boxes $B_{k+1}, \\ldots, B_{\\ell}$ lost two pebbles (and the other boxes are unchanged). Hence this configuration is strictly dominated by that before the first round, and it suffices to consider only Alice's other response.\n\n\nFor Alice. Let $K=\\left\\lfloor\\frac{N}{2}+1\\right\\rfloor$. Alice starts with the boxes in the configuration $V_{K}$. For each of Bob's $N-1$ possible choices, consider the subset of rounds in which he makes that choice. In that subset of rounds, Alice alternates between picking the left group and picking the right group; the first time Bob makes that choice, Alice picks the group containing the $K^{\\text {th }}$ box. Thus, at any time during the game, the number of pebbles in each box depends only on which choices Bob has made an odd number of times. This means that the number of pebbles in a box could decrease by at most the number of choices for which Alice would have started by removing a pebble from the group containing that box. These numbers are, for each box,\n\n$$\n\\left\\lfloor\\frac{N}{2}\\right\\rfloor,\\left\\lfloor\\frac{N}{2}-1\\right\\rfloor, \\ldots, 1,0,1, \\ldots,\\left\\lceil\\frac{N}{2}-1\\right\\rceil\n$$\n\nThese are pointwise less than the numbers of pebbles the boxes started with, meaning that no box ever becomes empty with this strategy.\n\nSo the final answer is $n=960$. In general, if there are $N>1$ boxes, the answer is $n=\\left\\lfloor\\frac{N}{2}+1\\right\\rfloor\\left\\lceil\\frac{N}{2}+1\\right\\rceil-1$.\n\nCommon remarks. We present solutions for the general case of $N>1$ boxes, and write $M=\\left\\lfloor\\frac{N}{2}+1\\right\\rfloor\\left\\lceil\\frac{N}{2}+1\\right\\rceil-1$ for the claimed answer. For $1 \\leqslant k<N$, say that Bob makes a $k$-move if he splits the boxes into a left group $\\left\\{B_{1}, \\ldots, B_{k}\\right\\}$ and a right group $\\left\\{B_{k+1}, \\ldots, B_{N}\\right\\}$. Say that one configuration dominates another if it has at least as many pebbles in each box, and say that it strictly dominates the other configuration if it also has more pebbles in at least one box. (Thus, if Bob wins in some configuration, he also wins in every configuration that it dominates.)\n\nIt is often convenient to consider ' $V$-shaped' configurations; for $1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant N$, let $V_{i}$ be the configuration where $B_{j}$ contains $1+|j-i|$ pebbles (i.e. where the $i^{\\text {th }}$ box has a single pebble and the numbers increase by one in both directions, so the first box has $i$ pebbles and the last box has $N+1-i$ pebbles). Note that $V_{i}$ contains $\\frac{1}{2} i(i+1)+\\frac{1}{2}(N+1-i)(N+2-i)-1$ pebbles. If $i=\\left\\lceil\\frac{N}{2}\\right\\rceil$, this number equals $M$.\n\nFor Bob. Let $K=\\left\\lfloor\\frac{N}{2}+1\\right\\rfloor$. For Bob's strategy, we consider a configuration $X$ with at most $M-1$ pebbles, and we make use of Observation A. Consider two configurations with $M$ pebbles: $V_{K}$ and $V_{N+1-K}$ (if $n$ is odd, they are the same configuration; if $n$ is even, one is the reverse of the other). The configuration $X$ has fewer pebbles than $V_{K}$ in at least one box, and fewer pebbles than $V_{N+1-K}$ in at least one box.\n\nSuppose first that, with respect to one of those configurations (without loss of generality $V_{K}$ ), $X$ has fewer pebbles in one of the boxes in the half where they have $1,2, \\ldots,\\left\\lceil\\frac{N}{2}\\right\\rceil$ pebbles (the right half in $V_{K}$ if $N$ is even; if $N$ is odd, we can take it to be the right half, without loss of generality, as the configuration is symmetric). Note that the number cannot be fewer in the box with 1 pebble in $V_{K}$, because then it would have 0 pebbles. Bob then does a $K$-move. If Alice picks the right group, the total number of pebbles goes down and we restart Bob's strategy with a smaller number of pebbles. If Alice picks the left group, Bob follows with a $(K+1)$-move, a $(K+2)$-move, and so on; by Observation A we may assume Alice always picks the left group. But whichever box in the right half had fewer pebbles in $X$ than in $V_{K}$ ends up with 0 pebbles at some point in this sequence of moves.\n\nOtherwise, $N$ is even, and for both of those configurations, there are fewer pebbles in $X$ only on the $2,3, \\ldots, \\frac{N}{2}+1$ side. That is, the numbers of pebbles in $X$ are at least\n\n$$\n\\frac{N}{2}, \\frac{N}{2}-1, \\ldots, 1,1, \\ldots, \\frac{N}{2}\n\\tag{C}\n$$\n\nwith equality occurring at least once on each side. Bob does an $\\frac{N}{2}$-move. Whichever group Alice chooses, the total number of pebbles is unchanged, and the side from which pebbles are removed now has a box with fewer pebbles than in $(C)$, so the previous case of Bob's strategy can now be applied."], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Combinatorics", "code": ["## Step 1: Understand the rules of the game\nAlice and Bob play a game where Alice starts by distributing $n$ pebbles into 60 boxes. In each subsequent round, Bob splits the boxes into two groups and Alice adds a pebble to each box in one group and removes a pebble from each box in the other group. The goal for Bob is to have a box with no pebbles, and for Alice to prevent this.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the conditions for Bob to win\nFor Bob to win, there must be a round where one of the groups has no pebbles. This means that at some point, one of the groups must have a total number of pebbles that is less than the number of boxes in that group.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the minimum number of pebbles Alice needs to distribute\nTo prevent Bob from winning, Alice must ensure that at the end of each round, each group has at least as many pebbles as the number of boxes in that group. This means that the total number of pebbles distributed by Alice must be at least the sum of the number of boxes in each group.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the minimum number of pebbles Alice needs to distribute\nSince there are 60 boxes, the minimum number of pebbles Alice needs to distribute is the sum of the number of boxes in each group, which is $1+2+3+\\ldots+59+60 = \\frac{60 \\cdot 61}{2} = 1830$.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the parity of the number of pebbles\nHowever, we also need to consider the parity of the number of pebbles. If the number of pebbles is odd, then after each round, the number of pebbles in each group will be odd, and one of the groups will have an odd number of pebbles. This means that Bob can always choose a group with an odd number of pebbles and split it, ensuring that one of the groups will have no pebbles.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the smallest n that satisfies the conditions\nTo prevent Bob from winning, the number of pebbles must be even. The smallest even number that satisfies the condition is $n = 1830 + 1 = 1831$.\n\n## Step 7: Consider the parity of the number of pebbles in each box\nHowever, we also need to consider the parity of the number of pebbles in each box.

Now let $(a, b, c)$ be any triple with the desired property. If we would have $a=1$, then both $b-c$ and $c-b$ were powers of 2 , which is impossible since their sum is zero; because of symmetry, this argument shows $a, b, c \\geqslant 2$.\n\nCase 1. Among $a, b$, and $c$ there are at least two equal numbers.\n\nWithout loss of generality we may suppose that $a=b$. Then $a^{2}-c$ and $a(c-1)$ are powers of 2. The latter tells us that actually $a$ and $c-1$ are powers of 2 . So there are nonnegative integers $\\alpha$ and $\\gamma$ with $a=2^{\\alpha}$ and $c=2^{\\gamma}+1$. Since $a^{2}-c=2^{2 \\alpha}-2^{\\gamma}-1$ is a power of 2 and thus incongruent to -1 modulo 4 , we must have $\\gamma \\leqslant 1$. Moreover, each of the terms $2^{2 \\alpha}-2$ and $2^{2 \\alpha}-3$ can only be a power of 2 if $\\alpha=1$. It follows that the triple $(a, b, c)$ is either $(2,2,2)$ or $(2,2,3)$.\n\nCase 2. The numbers $a, b$, and $c$ are distinct.\n\nDue to symmetry we may suppose that\n\n$$\n2 \\leqslant a<b<c .\n\\tag{1}\n$$\n\nWe are to prove that the triple $(a, b, c)$ is either $(2,6,11)$ or $(3,5,7)$. By our hypothesis, there exist three nonnegative integers $\\alpha, \\beta$, and $\\gamma$ such that\n\n$$\nb c-a  =2^{\\alpha}, \\tag{2}\n$$\n$$\na c-b  =2^{\\beta}, \\tag{3}\n$$\n$$\n\\text { and } \\quad a b-c =2^{\\gamma} .\\tag{4}\n$$\n\nEvidently we have\n\n$$\n\\alpha>\\beta>\\gamma\\tag{5}\n$$\n\nDepending on how large $a$ is, we divide the argument into two further cases.\n\nCase 2.1. $\\quad a=2$.\n\nWe first prove that $\\gamma=0$. Assume for the sake of contradiction that $\\gamma>0$. Then $c$ is even by (4) and, similarly, $b$ is even by (5) and (3). So the left-hand side of (2) is congruent to 2 modulo 4 , which is only possible if $b c=4$. As this contradicts (1), we have thereby shown that $\\gamma=0$, i.e., that $c=2 b-1$.\n\nNow (3) yields $3 b-2=2^{\\beta}$. Due to $b>2$ this is only possible if $\\beta \\geqslant 4$. If $\\beta=4$, then we get $b=6$ and $c=2 \\cdot 6-1=11$, which is a solution. It remains to deal with the case $\\beta \\geqslant 5$. Now (2) implies\n\n$$\n9 \\cdot 2^{\\alpha}=9 b(2 b-1)-18=(3 b-2)(6 b+1)-16=2^{\\beta}\\left(2^{\\beta+1}+5\\right)-16,\n$$\n\nand by $\\beta \\geqslant 5$ the right-hand side is not divisible by 32 . Thus $\\alpha \\leqslant 4$ and we get a contradiction to (5).\n\n\n\nCase 2.2. $a \\geqslant 3$.\n\nPick an integer $\\vartheta \\in\\{-1,+1\\}$ such that $c-\\vartheta$ is not divisible by 4 . Now\n\n$$\n2^{\\alpha}+\\vartheta \\cdot 2^{\\beta}=\\left(b c-a \\vartheta^{2}\\right)+\\vartheta(c a-b)=(b+a \\vartheta)(c-\\vartheta)\n$$\n\nis divisible by $2^{\\beta}$ and, consequently, $b+a \\vartheta$ is divisible by $2^{\\beta-1}$. On the other hand, $2^{\\beta}=a c-b>$ $(a-1) c \\geqslant 2 c$ implies in view of (1) that $a$ and $b$ are smaller than $2^{\\beta-1}$. All this is only possible if $\\vartheta=1$ and $a+b=2^{\\beta-1}$. Now (3) yields\n\n$$\na c-b=2(a+b),\n\\tag{6}\n$$\n\nwhence $4 b>a+3 b=a(c-1) \\geqslant a b$, which in turn yields $a=3$.\n\nSo (6) simplifies to $c=b+2$ and (2) tells us that $b(b+2)-3=(b-1)(b+3)$ is a power of 2. Consequently, the factors $b-1$ and $b+3$ are powers of 2 themselves. Since their difference is 4 , this is only possible if $b=5$ and thus $c=7$. Thereby the solution is complete.", "As in the beginning of the first solution, we observe that $a, b, c \\geqslant 2$. Depending on the parities of $a, b$, and $c$ we distinguish three cases.\n\nCase 1. The numbers $a, b$, and $c$ are even.\n\nLet $2^{A}, 2^{B}$, and $2^{C}$ be the largest powers of 2 dividing $a, b$, and $c$ respectively. We may assume without loss of generality that $1 \\leqslant A \\leqslant B \\leqslant C$. Now $2^{B}$ is the highest power of 2 dividing $a c-b$, whence $a c-b=2^{B} \\leqslant b$. Similarly, we deduce $b c-a=2^{A} \\leqslant a$. Adding both estimates we get $(a+b) c \\leqslant 2(a+b)$, whence $c \\leqslant 2$. So $c=2$ and thus $A=B=C=1$; moreover, we must have had equality throughout, i.e., $a=2^{A}=2$ and $b=2^{B}=2$. We have thereby found the solution $(a, b, c)=(2,2,2)$.\n\nCase 2. The numbers $a, b$, and $c$ are odd.\n\nIf any two of these numbers are equal, say $a=b$, then $a c-b=a(c-1)$ has a nontrivial odd divisor and cannot be a power of 2 . Hence $a, b$, and $c$ are distinct. So we may assume without loss of generality that $a<b<c$.\n\nLet $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ denote the nonnegative integers for which $b c-a=2^{\\alpha}$ and $a c-b=2^{\\beta}$ hold. Clearly, we have $\\alpha>\\beta$, and thus $2^{\\beta}$ divides\n\n$$\na \\cdot 2^{\\alpha}-b \\cdot 2^{\\beta}=a(b c-a)-b(a c-b)=b^{2}-a^{2}=(b+a)(b-a) .\n$$\n\nSince $a$ is odd, it is not possible that both factors $b+a$ and $b-a$ are divisible by 4 . Consequently, one of them has to be a multiple of $2^{\\beta-1}$. Hence one of the numbers $2(b+a)$ and $2(b-a)$ is divisible by $2^{\\beta}$ and in either case we have\n\n$$\na c-b=2^{\\beta} \\leqslant 2(a+b) .\n\\tag{7}\n$$\n\nThis in turn yields $(a-1) b<a c-b<4 b$ and thus $a=3$ (recall that $a$ is odd and larger than 1). Substituting this back into (7) we learn $c \\leqslant b+2$. But due to the parity $b<c$ entails that $b+2 \\leqslant c$ holds as well. So we get $c=b+2$ and from $b c-a=(b-1)(b+3)$ being a power of 2 it follows that $b=5$ and $c=7$.\n\nCase 3. Among $a, b$, and $c$ both parities occur.\n\nWithout loss of generality, we suppose that $c$ is odd and that $a \\leqslant b$. We are to show that $(a, b, c)$ is either $(2,2,3)$ or $(2,6,11)$. As at least one of $a$ and $b$ is even, the expression $a b-c$ is odd; since it is also a power of 2 , we obtain\n\n$$\na b-c=1 \\text {. }\n\\tag{8}\n$$\n\nIf $a=b$, then $c=a^{2}-1$, and from $a c-b=a\\left(a^{2}-2\\right)$ being a power of 2 it follows that both $a$ and $a^{2}-2$ are powers of 2 , whence $a=2$. This gives rise to the solution $(2,2,3)$.\n\n\n\nWe may suppose $a<b$ from now on. As usual, we let $\\alpha>\\beta$ denote the integers satisfying\n\n$$\n2^{\\alpha}=b c-a \\quad \\text { and } \\quad 2^{\\beta}=a c-b\n\\tag{9}\n$$\n\nIf $\\beta=0$ it would follow that $a c-b=a b-c=1$ and hence that $b=c=1$, which is absurd. So $\\beta$ and $\\alpha$ are positive and consequently $a$ and $b$ are even. Substituting $c=a b-1$ into (9) we obtain\n\n$$\n2^{\\alpha}  =a b^{2}-(a+b), \\tag{10}\n$$\n$$\n\\text { and } \\quad 2^{\\beta}  =a^{2} b-(a+b) .\n\\tag{11}\n$$\n\nThe addition of both equation yields $2^{\\alpha}+2^{\\beta}=(a b-2)(a+b)$. Now $a b-2$ is even but not divisible by 4 , so the highest power of 2 dividing $a+b$ is $2^{\\beta-1}$. For this reason, the equations (10) and (11) show that the highest powers of 2 dividing either of the numbers $a b^{2}$ and $a^{2} b$ is likewise $2^{\\beta-1}$. Thus there is an integer $\\tau \\geqslant 1$ together with odd integers $A, B$, and $C$ such that $a=2^{\\tau} A, b=2^{\\tau} B, a+b=2^{3 \\tau} C$, and $\\beta=1+3 \\tau$.\n\nNotice that $A+B=2^{2 \\tau} C \\geqslant 4 C$. Moreover, (11) entails $A^{2} B-C=2$. Thus $8=$ $4 A^{2} B-4 C \\geqslant 4 A^{2} B-A-B \\geqslant A^{2}(3 B-1)$. Since $A$ and $B$ are odd with $A<B$, this is only possible if $A=1$ and $B=3$. Finally, one may conclude $C=1, \\tau=1, a=2, b=6$, and $c=11$. We have thereby found the triple $(2,6,11)$. This completes the discussion of the third case, and hence the solution.

It remains to show the converse.\n\nAssume that $f$ is a function satisfying the problem condition. Notice that the function $g(x)=f(x)-f(0)$ also satisfies this condition. Replacing $f$ by $g$, we assume from now on that $f(0)=0$; then $f(n)>0$ for any positive integer $n$. Thus, we aim to prove that there exists a positive integer $a$ with $\\mho(a)=0$ such that $f(n)=a n$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nWe start by introducing some notation. Set $N=10^{100}$. We say that a prime $p$ is large if $p>N$, and $p$ is small otherwise; let $\\mathcal{S}$ be the set of all small primes. Next, we say that a positive integer is large or small if all its prime factors are such (thus, the number 1 is the unique number which is both large and small). For a positive integer $k$, we denote the greatest large divisor of $k$ and the greatest small divisor of $k$ by $L(k)$ and $S(k)$, respectively; thus, $k=L(k) S(k)$.\n\nWe split the proof into three steps.\n\nStep 1. We prove that for every large $k$, we have $k|f(a)-f(b) \\Longleftrightarrow k| a-b$. In other $\\overline{\\text { words, }} L(f(a)-f(b))=L(a-b)$ for all integers $a$ and $b$ with $a>b$.\n\nWe use induction on $k$. The base case $k=1$ is trivial. For the induction step, assume that $k_{0}$ is a large number, and that the statement holds for all large numbers $k$ with $k<k_{0}$.\n\nClaim 1. For any integers $x$ and $y$ with $0<x-y<k_{0}$, the number $k_{0}$ does not divide $f(x)-f(y)$.\n\nProof. Assume, to the contrary, that $k_{0} \\mid f(x)-f(y)$. Let $\\ell=L(x-y)$; then $\\ell \\leqslant x-y<k_{0}$. By the induction hypothesis, $\\ell \\mid f(x)-f(y)$, and thus $\\operatorname{lcm}\\left(k_{0}, \\ell\\right) \\mid f(x)-f(y)$. Notice that $\\operatorname{lcm}\\left(k_{0}, \\ell\\right)$ is large, and $\\operatorname{lcm}\\left(k_{0}, \\ell\\right) \\geqslant k_{0}>\\ell$. But then\n\n$$\n\\mho(f(x)-f(y)) \\geqslant \\mho\\left(\\operatorname{lcm}\\left(k_{0}, \\ell\\right)\\right)>\\mho(\\ell)=\\mho(x-y),\n$$\n\nwhich is impossible.\n\nNow we complete the induction step. By Claim 1, for every integer $a$ each of the sequences\n\n$$\nf(a), f(a+1), \\ldots, f\\left(a+k_{0}-1\\right) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad f(a+1), f(a+2), \\ldots, f\\left(a+k_{0}\\right)\n$$\n\nforms a complete residue system modulo $k_{0}$. This yields $f(a) \\equiv f\\left(a+k_{0}\\right)\\left(\\bmod k_{0}\\right)$. Thus, $f(a) \\equiv f(b)\\left(\\bmod k_{0}\\right)$ whenever $a \\equiv b\\left(\\bmod k_{0}\\right)$.\n\nFinally, if $a \\not \\equiv b\\left(\\bmod k_{0}\\right)$ then there exists an integer $b^{\\prime}$ such that $b^{\\prime} \\equiv b\\left(\\bmod k_{0}\\right)$ and $\\left|a-b^{\\prime}\\right|<k_{0}$. Then $f(b) \\equiv f\\left(b^{\\prime}\\right) \\not \\equiv f(a)\\left(\\bmod k_{0}\\right)$. The induction step is proved.\n\nStep 2. We prove that for some small integer a there exist infinitely many integers $n$ such that $\\overline{f(n)}=$ an. In other words, $f$ is linear on some infinite set.\n\nWe start with the following general statement.\n\n\n\nClaim 2. There exists a constant $c$ such that $f(t)<c t$ for every positive integer $t>N$.\n\nProof. Let $d$ be the product of all small primes, and let $\\alpha$ be a positive integer such that $2^{\\alpha}>f(N)$. Then, for every $p \\in \\mathcal{S}$ the numbers $f(0), f(1), \\ldots, f(N)$ are distinct modulo $p^{\\alpha}$. Set $P=d^{\\alpha}$ and $c=P+f(N)$.\n\nChoose any integer $t>N$. Due to the choice of $\\alpha$, for every $p \\in \\mathcal{S}$ there exists at most one nonnegative integer $i \\leqslant N$ with $p^{\\alpha} \\mid f(t)-f(i)$. Since $|\\mathcal{S}|<N$, we can choose a nonnegative integer $j \\leqslant N$ such that $p^{\\alpha} \\nmid f(t)-f(j)$ for all $p \\in \\mathcal{S}$. Therefore, $S(f(t)-f(j))<P$.\n\nOn the other hand, Step 1 shows that $L(f(t)-f(j))=L(t-j) \\leqslant t-j$. Since $0 \\leqslant j \\leqslant N$, this yields\n\n$$\nf(t)=f(j)+L(f(t)-f(j)) \\cdot S(f(t)-f(j))<f(N)+(t-j) P \\leqslant(P+f(N)) t=c t\n$$\n\nNow let $\\mathcal{T}$ be the set of large primes. For every $t \\in \\mathcal{T}$, Step 1 implies $L(f(t))=t$, so the ratio $f(t) / t$ is an integer. Now Claim 2 leaves us with only finitely many choices for this ratio, which means that there exists an infinite subset $\\mathcal{T}^{\\prime} \\subseteq \\mathcal{T}$ and a positive integer $a$ such that $f(t)=a t$ for all $t \\in \\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}$, as required.\n\nSince $L(t)=L(f(t))=L(a) L(t)$ for all $t \\in \\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}$, we get $L(a)=1$, so the number $a$ is small.\n\nStep 3. We show that $f(x)=$ ax for all $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nLet $R_{i}=\\{x \\in \\mathbb{Z}: x \\equiv i(\\bmod N !)\\}$ denote the residue class of $i$ modulo $N !$.\n\nClaim 3. Assume that for some $r$, there are infinitely many $n \\in R_{r}$ such that $f(n)=a n$. Then $f(x)=a x$ for all $x \\in R_{r+1}$.\n\nProof. Choose any $x \\in R_{r+1}$. By our assumption, we can select $n \\in R_{r}$ such that $f(n)=$ an and $|n-x|>|f(x)-a x|$. Since $n-x \\equiv r-(r+1)=-1(\\bmod N !)$, the number $|n-x|$ is large. Therefore, by Step 1 we have $f(x) \\equiv f(n)=a n \\equiv a x(\\bmod n-x)$, so $n-x \\mid f(x)-a x$. Due to the choice of $n$, this yields $f(x)=a x$.\n\nTo complete Step 3, notice that the set $\\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}$ found in Step 2 contains infinitely many elements of some residue class $R_{i}$. Applying Claim 3, we successively obtain that $f(x)=a x$ for all $x \\in R_{i+1}, R_{i+2}, \\ldots, R_{i+N !}=R_{i}$.

To reach this we let $P$ denote any polynomial satisfying (1) and $P(0) \\geqslant 0$; as we shall see, this implies $P(x)=x^{2}+1$ for all real $x$, which is actually more than what we want.\n\nFirst step: We prove that $P$ is even.\n\nBy (1) we have\n\n$$\n\\left|y^{2}-P(x)\\right| \\leqslant 2|x| \\Longleftrightarrow\\left|x^{2}-P(y)\\right| \\leqslant 2|y| \\Longleftrightarrow\\left|y^{2}-P(-x)\\right| \\leqslant 2|x|\n$$\n\nfor all real numbers $x$ and $y$.

We claim that there are infinitely many real numbers $x$ such that $P(x)+2|x| \\geqslant 0$. This holds in fact for any real polynomial with $P(0) \\geqslant 0$; in order to see this, we may assume that the coefficient of $P$ appearing in front of $x$ is nonnegative. In this case the desired inequality holds for all sufficiently small positive real numbers.\n\nFor such numbers $x$ satisfying $P(x)+2|x| \\geqslant 0$ we have $P(x)+2|x|=P(-x)+2|x|$ by the previous displayed formula, and hence also $P(x)=P(-x)$. Consequently the polynomial $P(x)-P(-x)$ has infinitely many zeros, wherefore it has to vanish identically. Thus $P$ is indeed even.\n\n\n\nSecond step: We prove that $P(t)>0$ for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nLet us assume for a moment that there exists a real number $t \\neq 0$ with $P(t)=0$. Then there is some open interval $I$ around $t$ such that $|P(y)| \\leqslant 2|y|$ holds for all $y \\in I$. Plugging $x=0$ into (1) we learn that $y^{2}=P(0)$ holds for all $y \\in I$, which is clearly absurd. We have thus shown $P(t) \\neq 0$ for all $t \\neq 0$.\n\nIn combination with $P(0) \\geqslant 0$ this informs us that our claim could only fail if $P(0)=0$. In this case there is by our first step a polynomial $Q(x)$ such that $P(x)=x^{2} Q(x)$. Applying (1) to $x=0$ and an arbitrary $y \\neq 0$ we get $|y Q(y)|>2$, which is surely false when $y$ is sufficiently small.\n\nThird step: We prove that $P$ is a quadratic polynomial.\n\nNotice that $P$ cannot be constant, for otherwise if $x=\\sqrt{P(0)}$ and $y$ is sufficiently large, the first part of (1) is false whilst the second part is true. So the degree $n$ of $P$ has to be at least 1 . By our first step $n$ has to be even as well, whence in particular $n \\geqslant 2$.\n\nNow assume that $n \\geqslant 4$. Plugging $y=\\sqrt{P(x)}$ into (1) we get $\\left|x^{2}-P(\\sqrt{P(x)})\\right| \\leqslant 2 \\sqrt{P(x)}$ and hence\n\n$$\nP(\\sqrt{P(x)}) \\leqslant x^{2}+2 \\sqrt{P(x)}\n$$\n\nfor all real $x$. Choose positive real numbers $x_{0}, a$, and $b$ such that if $x \\in\\left(x_{0}, \\infty\\right)$, then $a x^{n}<$ $P(x)<b x^{n}$; this is indeed possible, for if $d>0$ denotes the leading coefficient of $P$, then $\\lim _{x \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{P(x)}{x^{n}}=d$, whence for instance the numbers $a=\\frac{d}{2}$ and $b=2 d$ work provided that $x_{0}$ is chosen large enough.\n\nNow for all sufficiently large real numbers $x$ we have\n\n$$\na^{n / 2+1} x^{n^{2} / 2}<a P(x)^{n / 2}<P(\\sqrt{P(x)}) \\leqslant x^{2}+2 \\sqrt{P(x)}<x^{n / 2}+2 b^{1 / 2} x^{n / 2},\n$$\n\ni.e.\n\n$$\nx^{\\left(n^{2}-n\\right) / 2}<\\frac{1+2 b^{1 / 2}}{a^{n / 2+1}}\n$$\n\nwhich is surely absurd. Thus $P$ is indeed a quadratic polynomial.\n\nFourth step: We prove that $P(x)=x^{2}+1$.\n\nIn the light of our first three steps there are two real numbers $a>0$ and $b$ such that $P(x)=$ $a x^{2}+b$. Now if $x$ is large enough and $y=\\sqrt{a} x$, the left part of (1) holds and the right part reads $\\left|\\left(1-a^{2}\\right) x^{2}-b\\right| \\leqslant 2 \\sqrt{a} x$. In view of the fact that $a>0$ this is only possible if $a=1$. Finally, substituting $y=x+1$ with $x>0$ into (1) we get\n\n$$\n|2 x+1-b| \\leqslant 2 x \\Longleftrightarrow|2 x+1+b| \\leqslant 2 x+2,\n$$\n\ni.e.,\n\n$$\nb \\in[1,4 x+1] \\Longleftrightarrow b \\in[-4 x-3,1]\n$$\n\nfor all $x>0$.

Suppose that this was not the case, and assume without loss of generality that $a_{2}<b_{2}$. Then the relative order of $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}$ is fixed, and the position of $b_{1}$ has to decide the winner.

It is easy to see that $\\prec^{\\circ}$ defines a rule to determine a winner that satisfies the three conditions of our problem as well as the relation of the first case. So it follows in the same way as in the first case that for some $i, A \\prec^{\\circ} B$ if and only if the $i^{\\text {th }}$ smallest element of $A$ is less than the $i^{\\text {th }}$ smallest element of $B$, which is equivalent to the condition that the $i^{\\text {th }}$ largest element of $-A$ is greater than the $i^{\\text {th }}$ largest element of $-B$.

Giving the squares of the board coordinates in the natural manner, colour each square where at least one of its coordinates are divisible by 3 , shown below for a $9 \\times 9$ board:\n\n<img_3271>\n\nThen, as each $3 \\times 3$ square on the board contains exactly 5 coloured squares, each move of the gardener will cause at most 4 trees on non-coloured squares to grow. The lumberjack may therefore cut those trees, ensuring no tree on a non-coloured square has positive height after his turn. Hence there cannot ever be more majestic trees than coloured squares, which is $5 N^{2}$.\n\nNext, we prove the gardener may ensure there are $5 N^{2}$ majestic trees. In fact, we prove this statement in a modified game which is more difficult for the gardener: on the lumberjack's turn in the modified game, he may decrement the height of all trees on the board except those the gardener did not just grow, in addition to four of the trees the gardener just grew. Clearly, a sequence of moves for the gardener which ensures that there are $K$ majestic trees in the modified game also ensures this in the original game.\n\n\n\nLet $M=\\left(\\begin{array}{l}9 \\\\ 5\\end{array}\\right)$; we say that a $m a p$ is one of the $M$ possible ways to mark 5 squares on a $3 \\times 3$ board. In the modified game, after the gardener chooses a $3 \\times 3$ subboard on the board, the lumberjack chooses a map in this subboard, and the total result of the two moves is that each tree marked on the map increases its height by 1, each tree in the subboard which is not in the map remains unchanged, and each tree outside the subboard decreases its height by 1 . Also note that if the gardener chooses a $3 \\times 3$ subboard $M l$ times, the lumberjack will have to choose some map at least $l$ times, so there will be at least 5 trees which each have height $\\geqslant l$.\n\nThe strategy for the gardener will be to divide the board into $N^{2}$ disjoint $3 \\times 3$ subboards, number them $0, \\ldots, N^{2}-1$ in some order. Then, for $b=N^{2}-1, \\ldots, 0$ in order, he plays $10^{6} M(M+1)^{b}$ times on subboard number $b$. Hence, on subboard number $b$, the moves on that subboard will first ensure 5 of its trees grows by at least $10^{6}(M+1)^{b}$, and then each move after that will decrease their heights by 1 . (As the trees on subboard $b$ had height 0 before the gardener started playing there, no move made on subboards $\\geqslant b$ decreased their heights.) As the gardener makes $10^{6} M(M+1)^{b-1}+\\ldots=10^{6}\\left((M+1)^{b}-1\\right)$ moves after he finishes playing on subboard $b$, this means that on subboard $b$, there will be 5 trees of height at least $10^{6}(M+1)^{b}-10^{6}\\left((M+1)^{b}-1\\right)=10^{6}$, hence each of the subboard has 5 majestic trees, which was what we wanted."], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Combinatorics", "code": ["## Step 1: Understand the rules of the game\nThe game is played on a $2022 \\times 2022$ board, where the gardener and the lumberjack take turns.

If the lumberjack decreases the height of a tree that the gardener has increased by 1, the gardener's move is effectively cancelled out.

For an $n$-tuple $\\mathbf{v}$, we will write $\\mathbf{v}_{i}$ for its $i$-th coordinate (where $1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n$ ). For a positive integer $n$ and a tuple $\\mathbf{v}$ we will denote by $n \\cdot \\mathbf{v}$ the tuple obtained by applying addition on $\\mathbf{v}$ with itself $n$ times.

We say that a tuple is positive if all its coordinates are positive, and negative if all its coordinates are negative.\n\nWe will show that three tuples suffice, and then that two tuples do not suffice.\n\n**Three tuples suffice.** Write $\\mathbf{c}$ for the constant-valued tuple $\\mathbf{c}=(-1, \\ldots,-1)$.\n\nWe note that it is enough for Lucy to be able to make the tuples $\\mathbf{e}(1), \\ldots, \\mathbf{e}(n)$, $\\mathbf{c}$; from those any other tuple $\\mathbf{v}$ can be made as follows. First we choose some positive integer $k$ such that $k+\\mathbf{v}_{i}>0$ for all $i$. Then, by adding a positive number of copies of $\\mathbf{c}, \\mathbf{e}(1), \\ldots, \\mathbf{e}(n)$, she can make\n\n$$\nk \\mathbf{c}+\\left(k+\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\right) \\cdot \\mathbf{e}(1)+\\cdots+\\left(k+\\mathbf{v}_{n}\\right) \\cdot \\mathbf{e}(n)\n$$\n\nwhich we claim is equal to $\\mathbf{v}$. Indeed, this can be checked by comparing coordinates: the $i$-th coordinate of the right-hand side is $-k+\\left(k+\\mathbf{v}_{i}\\right)=\\mathbf{v}_{i}$ as needed.\n\nLucy can take her three starting tuples to be $\\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{b}$ and $\\mathbf{c}$, such that $\\mathbf{a}_{i}=-i^{2}, \\mathbf{b}_{i}=i$ and $\\mathbf{c}=-1$ (as above).\n\nFor any $1 \\leqslant j \\leqslant n$, write $\\mathbf{d}(j)$ for the tuple $2 \\cdot \\mathbf{a}+4 j \\cdot \\mathbf{b}+\\left(2 j^{2}-1\\right) \\cdot \\mathbf{c}$, which Lucy can make by adding together $\\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{b}$ and $\\mathbf{c}$ repeatedly.

Hence Lucy can produce the tuple $\\mathbf{1}=(1, \\ldots, 1)$ as $\\mathbf{d}(1) \\vee \\cdots \\vee \\mathbf{d}(n)$.\n\nShe can then produce the constant tuple $\\mathbf{0}=(0, \\ldots, 0)$ as $\\mathbf{1}+\\mathbf{c}$, and for any $1 \\leqslant j \\leqslant n$ she can then produce the tuple $\\mathbf{e}(j)$ as $\\mathbf{d}(j) \\vee \\mathbf{0}$. Since she can now produce $\\mathbf{e}(1), \\ldots, \\mathbf{e}(n)$ and already had $\\mathbf{c}$, she can (as we argued earlier) produce any integer-valued tuple.\n\n\n\n**Two tuples do not suffice.** We start with an observation: Let $a$ be a non-negative real number and suppose that two tuples $\\mathbf{v}$ and $\\mathbf{w}$ satisfy $\\mathbf{v}_{j} \\geqslant a \\mathbf{v}_{k}$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{j} \\geqslant a \\mathbf{w}_{k}$ for some $1 \\leqslant j, k \\leqslant n$.

Then $\\mathbf{m}_{j} \\geqslant \\mathbf{v}_{j} \\geqslant a \\mathbf{v}_{k}$ and $\\mathbf{m}_{j} \\geqslant \\mathbf{w}_{j} \\geqslant a \\mathbf{w}_{k}$. Since $\\mathbf{m}_{k}=\\mathbf{v}_{k}$ or $\\mathbf{m}_{k}=\\mathbf{w}_{k}$, the observation follows.\n\nAs a consequence of this observation we have that if all starting tuples satisfy such an inequality, then all generated tuples will also satisfy it, and so we would not be able to obtain every integer-valued tuple.\n\nLet us now prove that Lucy needs at least three starting tuples. For contradiction, let us suppose that Lucy started with only two tuples $\\mathbf{v}$ and $\\mathbf{w}$. We are going to distinguish two cases. In the first case, suppose we can find a coordinate $i$ such that $\\mathbf{v}_{i}, \\mathbf{w}_{i} \\geqslant 0$. Both operations preserve the sign, thus we can not generate any tuple that has negative $i$-th coordinate. Similarly for $\\mathbf{v}_{i}, \\mathbf{w}_{i} \\leqslant 0$.\n\nSuppose the opposite, i.e., for every $i$ we have either $\\mathbf{v}_{i}>0>\\mathbf{w}_{i}$, or $\\mathbf{v}_{i}<0<\\mathbf{w}_{i}$. Since we assumed that our tuples have at least three coordinates, by pigeonhole principle there exist two coordinates $j \\neq k$ such that $\\mathbf{v}_{j}$ has the same sign as $\\mathbf{v}_{k}$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{j}$ has the same sign as $\\mathbf{w}_{k}$ (because there are only two possible combinations of signs).\n\nWithout loss of generality assume that $\\mathbf{v}_{j}, \\mathbf{v}_{k}>0$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{j}, \\mathbf{w}_{k}<0$. Let us denote the positive real number $\\mathbf{v}_{j} / \\mathbf{v}_{k}$ by $a$. If $\\mathbf{w}_{j} / \\mathbf{w}_{k} \\leqslant a$, then both inequalities $\\mathbf{v}_{j} \\geqslant a \\mathbf{v}_{k}$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{j} \\geqslant a \\mathbf{w}_{k}$ are satisfied. On the other hand, if $\\mathbf{w}_{j} / \\mathbf{w}_{k} \\leqslant a$, then both $\\mathbf{v}_{k} \\geqslant(1 / a) \\mathbf{v}_{j}$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{k} \\geqslant(1 / a) \\mathbf{w}_{j}$ are satisfied.

Therefore, if we fill in the fields in $B$ in increasing order with respect to their values in $A$, it follows that each field not adjacent to any already filled field will receive a 1, while each field adjacent to already filled fields will receive the sum of the numbers already written on these adjacent fields.\n\nWe note that there is at least one well in $A$, that corresponding with the field with the entry 1 in $A$. Hence, the sum of values of fields in $B$ corresponding to wells in $A$ is at least 1 . We will now try to minimize the sum of the non-well entries, i.e. of the entries in $B$ corresponding to the non-wells in $A$. We note that we can ascribe to each pair of adjacent fields the value of the lower assigned number and that the sum of non-well entries will then equal to the sum of the ascribed numbers. Since the lower number is still at least 1, the sum of non-well entries will at least equal the number of pairs of adjacent fields, which is $2 n(n-1)$. Hence, the total minimum sum of entries in $B$ is at least $2 n(n-1)+1=2 n^{2}-2 n+1$. The necessary conditions for the minimum to be achieved is for there to be only one well and for no two entries in $B$ larger than 1 to be adjacent to each other.\n\nWe will now prove that the lower limit of $2 n^{2}-2 n+1$ entries can be achieved.

Then:\n\n- $\\left(k_{1}, l_{1}\\right)$ is a needle\n- so $\\left(k_{1} l_{2}, l_{1} l_{2}\\right)$ is a needle,\n- so $\\left(k_{2} l_{1}, l_{1} l_{2}\\right)$ is a needle (as $k_{2} l_{1}-k_{1} l_{2}>0$ and $(1,0)$ is a needle).\n\nThus $\\left(k_{2}, l_{2}\\right)$ is a needle, as wanted.\n\nClaim. A grade exists.\n\nProof. If no positive integer $n$ is a grade, then $f(1,0)>f(0, n)$ for all $n$ which is impossible.\n\nSimilarly, there is an $n$ such that $f(0,1)<f(n, 0)$, thus $1 / n$ is not a grade for some large $n$. That means that small positive rational values are not grades, then there is a switch, and after that all values are grades. Call the place of that switch $\\alpha$. Here $\\alpha$ is the infimum of the grades.\n\nClaim (Key property). If $x_{1}+y_{1} \\alpha>x_{2}+y_{2} \\alpha$ then $f\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)>f\\left(x_{2}, y_{2}\\right)$.\n\nProof. If both $x_{1} \\geqslant x_{2}$ and $y_{1} \\geqslant y_{2}$ this is clear.\n\nSuppose $x_{1} \\geqslant x_{2}$ and $y_{1}<y_{2}$. Then $\\frac{x_{1}-x_{2}}{y_{2}-y_{1}}>\\alpha$ is a grade. This gives $f\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)>f\\left(x_{2}, y_{2}\\right)$. Suppose $x_{1}<x_{2}$ and $y_{1} \\geqslant y_{2}$. Then $\\frac{x_{2}-x_{1}}{u_{1}-u_{2}}<\\alpha$ is not a grade. This gives $f\\left(x_{2}, y_{2}\\right)<f\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$.\n\nFrom those observations we get the following claim.\n\nClaim. The function $f$ orders pairs $(x, y)$ based on the value of $x+y \\alpha$. If $\\alpha$ is rational, tiebreaking is done by larger $x$ - or $y$-coordinate (depending on whether $\\alpha$ is a grade).\n\n\n\nWe can imagine this the following way: take a line with slope $-\\frac{1}{\\alpha}$ under the first quadrant of the plane. And we start to move this line upward (but it stays parallel to the original line). First it hits $(0,0)$, so $f(0,0)=0$. And each time the line hits a point $p, f(p)$ is the number of points hit before. If $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, it is possible that the line hits multiple points. Then those points are ordered the same way as their $x$ or $y$ coordinates, depending on whether $\\alpha$ is a grade.\n\nWe understood the behaviour of $f$, now we need to focus on the region of $A=\\{(x, y) \\in$ $\\left.\\mathbb{Z}_{\\geqslant 0} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{\\geqslant 0} \\mid x<100, y<100\\right\\}$. First, we can assume that $\\alpha$ is irrational. If we change it a little bit in the right direction, the behaviour and values of the $f$ function does not change in $A$.\n\nClaim.\n\n$$\nf(x, y)+f(x+1, y+1)=f(x+1, y)+f(x, y+1)+1\n$$\n\nProof.\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nf(x+1, y+1)-f(x, y+1)= \\\\\n\\#\\left\\{(a, b) \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\geqslant 0} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{\\geqslant 0} \\mid x+(y+1) \\alpha \\leqslant a+b \\alpha<(x+1)+(y+1) \\alpha\\right\\}= \\\\\n\\#\\left\\{(a, b) \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\geqslant 0} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \\mid x+(y+1) \\alpha \\leqslant a+b \\alpha<(x+1)+(y+1) \\alpha\\right\\}+ \\\\\n\\#\\left\\{(a, 0) \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\geqslant 0} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{\\geqslant 0} \\mid(x+1)+y \\alpha \\leqslant a<(x+1)+(y+1) \\alpha\\right\\}= \\\\\n\\#\\left\\{(a, b) \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\geqslant 0} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{\\geqslant 0} \\mid x+y \\alpha \\leqslant a+b \\alpha<(x+1)+y \\alpha\\right\\}+1=f(x+1, y)-f(x, y) .\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nFrom this claim we immediately get that $2500 \\leqslant N \\leqslant 7500$; now we show that those bounds are indeed sharp.\n\nRemember that if $\\alpha$ is irrational then\n\n$$\nf(a, b)=\\#\\left\\{(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\geqslant 0} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{\\geqslant 0} \\mid x+y \\alpha<a+b \\alpha\\right\\}\n$$\n\nConstruction for 7500 Select $\\alpha \\approx 199.999$.\n\nClaim. \n\n1. $f(n, 0)=n$ for $0 \\leqslant n \\leqslant 100$.\n2. $f(0, k) \\equiv k \\bmod 2$ for $0 \\leqslant k \\leqslant 100$.\n\nProof.\n\n1. $f(n, 0)=\\#\\{(x, y) \\mid x+y \\alpha<n\\}=\\#\\{(x, y) \\mid x+199 y<n\\}=n$.\n2. \n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nf(0, k)=\\#\\{(x, y) \\mid x+y \\alpha<k \\alpha\\}=\\sum_{l=0}^{k-1} \\#\\{(x, l) \\mid x+l \\alpha<k \\alpha\\} \\\\\n\\quad=\\sum_{l=0}^{k-1} \\#\\{x \\mid x<(k-l) \\alpha\\}=\\sum_{l=0}^{k-1} 200(k-l)-1=200 A-k\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nfor some integer $A$.\n\nFrom this claim, using the equality $f(x, y)+f(x+1, y+1)=f(x+1, y)+f(x, y+1)+1$, we can prove that mod 2 the region $A$ looks like the following: in the rows $(-, 2 y)$ the remainders modulo 2 alternate, while the rows $(-, 2 y+1)$ contain only odd numbers.\n\n\n\n<img_3591>\n\nThe numbers mod 2 in the construction for 7500.\n\nConstruction for 2500 Select $\\alpha \\approx 200.001$.\n\nClaim. \n\n1. $f(n, 0)=n$ for $0 \\leqslant n \\leqslant 100$.\n2. $f(0, k) \\equiv 0 \\bmod 2$ for $0 \\leqslant k \\leqslant 100$.\n\nProof.\n\n1.

We have $S(n, k)=a_{n-1}+S(n-1, k-1)$, so\n\n$$\nk\\left(M_{n}-a_{n-1}\\right)=S(n, k)-k a_{n-1}=S(n-1, k-1)-(k-1) a_{n-1} \\leqslant(k-1)\\left(M_{n-1}-a_{n-1}\\right),\n$$\n\nsince $S(n-1, k-1) \\leqslant(k-1) M_{n-1}$. Similarly, we get\n\n$$\n\\ell\\left(a_{n-1}-m_{n}\\right)=(\\ell-1) a_{n-1}-S(n-1, \\ell-1) \\leqslant(\\ell-1)\\left(a_{n-1}-m_{n-1}\\right) .\n$$\n\nSince $m_{n-1} \\leqslant a_{n-1} \\leqslant M_{n-1}$ and $k, \\ell \\leqslant n$, the obtained inequalities yield\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\nM_{n}-a_{n-1} \\leqslant \\frac{k-1}{k}\\left(M_{n-1}-a_{n-1}\\right) \\leqslant \\frac{n-1}{n}\\left(M_{n-1}-a_{n-1}\\right) \\text { and } \\\\\na_{n-1}-m_{n} \\leqslant \\frac{\\ell-1}{\\ell}\\left(a_{n-1}-m_{n-1}\\right) \\leqslant \\frac{n-1}{n}\\left(a_{n-1}-m_{n-1}\\right) .\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nTherefore,\n\n$$\n\\Delta_{n}=\\left(M_{n}-a_{n-1}\\right)+\\left(a_{n-1}-m_{n}\\right) \\leqslant \\frac{n-1}{n}\\left(\\left(M_{n-1}-a_{n-1}\\right)+\\left(a_{n-1}-m_{n-1}\\right)\\right)=\\frac{n-1}{n} \\Delta_{n-1}\n$$\n\nBack to the problem, if $a_{n}=1$ for all $n \\leqslant 2017$, then $a_{2018} \\leqslant 1$ and hence $a_{2018}-a_{2017} \\leqslant 0$. Otherwise, let $2 \\leqslant q \\leqslant 2017$ be the minimal index with $a_{q}<1$. We have $S(q, i)=i$ for all $i=1,2, \\ldots, q-1$, while $S(q, q)=q-1$. Therefore, $a_{q}<1$ yields $a_{q}=S(q, q) / q=1-\\frac{1}{q}$.\n\nNow we have $S(q+1, i)=i-\\frac{1}{q}$ for $i=1,2, \\ldots, q$, and $S(q+1, q+1)=q-\\frac{1}{q}$. This gives us\n\n$$\nm_{q+1}=\\frac{S(q+1,1)}{1}=\\frac{S(q+1, q+1)}{q+1}=\\frac{q-1}{q} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad M_{q+1}=\\frac{S(q+1, q)}{q}=\\frac{q^{2}-1}{q^{2}}\n$$\n\nso $\\Delta_{q+1}=M_{q+1}-m_{q+1}=(q-1) / q^{2}$. Denoting $N=2017 \\geqslant q$ and using Claim 1 for $n=q+2, q+3, \\ldots, N+1$ we finally obtain\n\n$$\n\\Delta_{N+1} \\leqslant \\frac{q-1}{q^{2}} \\cdot \\frac{q+1}{q+2} \\cdot \\frac{q+2}{q+3} \\cdots \\frac{N}{N+1}=\\frac{1}{N+1}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{q^{2}}\\right) \\leqslant \\frac{1}{N+1}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{N^{2}}\\right)=\\frac{N-1}{N^{2}},\n$$\n\nas required.", "We present a different proof of the estimate $a_{2018}-a_{2017} \\leqslant \\frac{2016}{2017^{2}}$. We keep the same notations of $S(n, k), m_{n}$ and $M_{n}$ from the previous solution.\n\nNotice that $S(n, n)=S(n, n-1)$, as $a_{0}=0$.

For every positive integer $n$, we have $m_{n} \\leqslant m_{n+1}$ and $M_{n+1} \\leqslant M_{n}$, so the segment $\\left[m_{n+1}, M_{n+1}\\right]$ is contained in $\\left[m_{n}, M_{n}\\right]$.\n\nProof. Choose a positive integer $k \\leqslant n+1$ such that $m_{n+1}=S(n+1, k) / k$.

By Claim 2, we have $\\left[m_{k}, M_{k}\\right] \\subseteq\\left[m_{k-1}, M_{k-1}\\right] \\subseteq \\cdots \\subseteq\\left[m_{n}, M_{n}\\right]$. Since $a_{k} \\in\\left[m_{k}, M_{k}\\right]$, the claim follows.\n\nClaim 4. For every integer $n \\geqslant 2$, we have $M_{n}=S(n, n-1) /(n-1)$ and $m_{n}=S(n, n) / n$.\n\nProof. We use induction on $n$. The base case $n=2$ is routine. To perform the induction step, we need to prove the inequalities\n\n$$\n\\frac{S(n, n)}{n} \\leqslant \\frac{S(n, k)}{k} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\frac{S(n, k)}{k} \\leqslant \\frac{S(n, n-1)}{n-1}\n\\tag{1}\n$$\n\nfor every positive integer $k \\leqslant n$. Clearly, these inequalities hold for $k=n$ and $k=n-1$, as $S(n, n)=S(n, n-1)>0$. In the sequel, we assume that $k<n-1$.\n\nNow the first inequality in (1) rewrites as $n S(n, k) \\geqslant k S(n, n)=k(S(n, k)+S(n-k, n-k))$, or, cancelling the terms occurring on both parts, as\n\n$$\n(n-k) S(n, k) \\geqslant k S(n-k, n-k) \\Longleftrightarrow S(n, k) \\geqslant k \\cdot \\frac{S(n-k, n-k)}{n-k}\n$$\n\nBy the induction hypothesis, we have $S(n-k, n-k) /(n-k)=m_{n-k}$. By Claim 3, we get $a_{n-i} \\geqslant m_{n-k}$ for all $i=1,2, \\ldots, k$. Summing these $k$ inequalities we obtain\n\n$$\nS(n, k) \\geqslant k m_{n-k}=k \\cdot \\frac{S(n-k, n-k)}{n-k}\n$$\n\nas required.\n\nThe second inequality in (1) is proved similarly. Indeed, this inequality is equivalent to\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n(n-1) S(n, k) \\leqslant k S(n, n-1) & \\Longleftrightarrow(n-k-1) S(n, k) \\leqslant k S(n-k, n-k-1) \\\\\n& \\Longleftrightarrow S(n, k) \\leqslant k \\cdot \\frac{S(n-k, n-k-1)}{n-k-1}=k M_{n-k} ;\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nthe last inequality follows again from Claim 3, as each term in $S(n, k)$ is at most $M_{n-k}$.\n\nNow we can prove the required estimate for $a_{2018}-a_{2017}$. Set $N=2017$. By Claim 4 ,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\na_{N+1}-a_{N} \\leqslant M_{N+1}-a_{N}=\\frac{S(N+1, N)}{N}-a_{N} & =\\frac{a_{N}+S(N, N-1)}{N}-a_{N} \\\\\n& =\\frac{S(N, N-1)}{N}-\\frac{N-1}{N} \\cdot a_{N} .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nOn the other hand, the same Claim yields\n\n$$\na_{N} \\geqslant m_{N}=\\frac{S(N, N)}{N}=\\frac{S(N, N-1)}{N}\n$$\n\nNoticing that each term in $S(N, N-1)$ is at most 1 , so $S(N, N-1) \\leqslant N-1$, we finally obtain\n\n$$\na_{N+1}-a_{N} \\leqslant \\frac{S(N, N-1)}{N}-\\frac{N-1}{N} \\cdot \\frac{S(N, N-1)}{N}=\\frac{S(N, N-1)}{N^{2}} \\leqslant \\frac{N-1}{N^{2}} .\n$$"], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Algebra", "code": ["## Step 1:  We are given a sequence of real numbers $a_0, a_1, a_2, \\ldots$ with initial values $a_0 = 0$ and $a_1 = 1$.

Two knights on squares of the same colour never attack each other. The number of black squares is $20^{2} / 2=200$.

From this point, Horst cannot put any knight on $A$ or $C$ because those squares are already occupied, neither on $B$ or $D$ because those squares are attacked by the knight standing on $A$. Hence, Horst can put at most one knight on each cycle, that is at most 100 knights in total."], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Combinatorics", "code": ["## Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem is asking us to find the maximum number of black knights that Horst can place on a 20x20 chessboard such that his new knight does not attack any previous knights, and regardless of Queenie's strategy, Horst can always place at least that many knights.\n\n## Step 2: Consider the movement of a knight\nA knight moves in an L-shape (two squares in one direction, then one square to the side). This means that a knight can attack a square if it is two squares away horizontally and one square away vertically, or one square away horizontally and two squares away vertically.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the maximum number of knights that can be placed in a row or column\nSince a knight can attack a square if it is two squares away horizontally and one square away vertically, or one square away horizontally and two squares away vertically, no two knights can be placed in the same row or column.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the maximum number of knights that can be placed in a row or column\nSince there are 20 squares in a row or column, and no two knights can be placed in the same row or column, the maximum number of knights that can be placed in a row or column is 20.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the maximum number of knights that can be placed on the board\nSince there are 20 rows and 20 columns, and no two knights can be placed in the same row or column, the maximum number of knights that can be placed on the board is 20*20 = 400. However, this is not the correct answer, as we need to consider the movement of the queen.\n\n## Step 6: Consider the movement of the queen\nA queen can move horizontally, vertically, or diagonally any number of squares. This means that a queen can attack any square in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n\n## Step 7: Determine the maximum number of knights that can be placed on the board considering the queen's movement\nSince a queen can attack any square in the same row, column, or diagonal, a knight cannot be placed in the same row, column, or diagonal as a queen. Therefore, the maximum number of knights that can be placed on the board is limited by the number of rows, columns, and diagonals that do not contain a queen.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the maximum number of knights that can be placed on the board considering the queen's movement\nSince there are 20 rows, 20 columns, and 20 diagonals, and a knight cannot be placed in the same row, column, or diagonal as a queen, the maximum number of knights that can be placed on the board is 20*20 - 20 = 380.\n\n## Step 9: Consider the fact that the queen can block a knight's movement\nHowever, the queen can also block a knight's movement by placing herself in the same row, column, or diagonal as the knight. This means that the maximum number of knights that can be placed on the board is actually lower than 380.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate the maximum number of knights that can be placed on the board considering the queen's movement and blocking\nTo maximize the number of knights, Horst should place his knights in the rows, columns, and diagonals that do not contain a queen. Since there are 20 rows, 20 columns, and 20 diagonals, and a knight cannot be placed in the same row, column, or diagonal as a queen, the maximum number of knights that can be placed on the board is 20*20 - 20 = 380.

Since a knight can move in an L-shape, a knight can attack a square in a 3x3 sub-grid if it is two squares away horizontally and one square away vertically, or one square away horizontally and two squares away vertically. This means that a knight cannot be placed in a 3x3 sub-grid that contains a queen.\n\n## Step 12: Calculate the maximum number of 3x3 sub-grids that can be formed on the board\nSince there are 20 rows, 20 columns, and 20 diagonals, and a 3x3 sub-grid can be formed by selecting a row, column, and diagonal, the maximum number of 3x3 sub-grids that can be formed on the board is 20*20*20 = 8000.\n\n## Step 13: Calculate the maximum number of knights that can be placed on the board considering the queen's movement and blocking\nSince a knight cannot be placed in a 3x3 sub-grid that contains a queen, the maximum number of knights that can be placed on the board is 8000 - 20 = 7980.\n\n## Step 14: Consider the fact that the queen can block a knight's movement in a 4x4 sub-grid\nA 4x4 sub-grid can be formed by selecting two rows and two columns. Since a knight can move in an L-shape, a knight can attack a square in a 4x4 sub-grid if it is two squares away horizontally and one square away vertically, or one square away horizontally and two squares away vertically. This means that a knight cannot be placed in a 4x4 sub-grid that contains a queen.\n\n## Step 15: Calculate the maximum number of 4x4 sub-grids that can be formed on the board\nSince there are 20 rows and 20 columns, and a 4x4 sub-grid can be formed by selecting two rows and two columns, the maximum number of 4x4 sub-grids that can be formed on the board is (20*19)/2 = 190.\n\n## Step 16: Calculate the maximum number of knights that can be placed on the board considering the queen's movement and blocking\nSince a knight cannot be placed in a 4x4 sub-grid that contains a queen, the maximum number of knights that can be placed on the board is 190*4 = 760.\n\n## Step 17: Consider the fact that the queen can block a knight's movement in a 5x5 sub-grid\nA 5x5 sub-grid can be formed by selecting three rows and two columns, or two rows and three columns. Since a knight can move in an L-shape, a knight can attack a square in a 5x5 sub-grid if it is two squares away horizontally and one square away vertically, or one square away horizontally and two squares away vertically. This means that a knight cannot be placed in a 5x5 sub-grid that contains a queen.\n\n## Step 18: Calculate the maximum number of 5x5 sub-grids that can be formed on the board\nSince there are 20 rows and 20 columns, and a 5x5 sub-grid can be formed by selecting three rows and two columns, or two rows and three columns, the maximum number of 5x5 sub-grids that can be formed on the board is (20*19*18)/2 + (20*19*18)/2 = 1716.\n\n## Step 19: Calculate the maximum number of knights that can be placed on the board considering the queen's movement and blocking\nSince a knight cannot be placed in a 5x5 sub-grid that contains a queen, the maximum number of knights that can be placed on the board is 1716*5 = 8580.\n\n## Step 20: Consider the fact that the queen can block a knight's movement in a 6x6 sub-grid\nA 6x6 sub-grid can be formed by selecting four rows and two columns, or two rows and four columns. Since a knight can move in an L-shape, a knight can attack a square in a 6x6 sub-grid if it is two squares away horizontally and one square away vertically, or one square away horizontally and two squares away vertically. This means that a knight cannot be placed in a 6x6 sub-grid that contains a queen.\n\n## Step 21: Calculate the maximum number of 6x6 sub-grids that can be formed on the board\nSince there are 20 rows and 20 columns, and a 6x6 sub-grid can be formed by selecting four rows and two columns, or two rows and four columns, the maximum number of 6x6 sub-grids that can be formed on the board is (20*19*18*17)/2 + (20*19*18*17)/2 = 9696.\n\n## Step 22: Calculate the maximum number of knights that can be placed on the board considering the queen's movement and blocking\nSince a knight cannot be placed in a 6x6 sub-grid that contains a queen, the maximum number of knights that can be placed on the board is 9696*6 = 58176.\n\n## Step 23: Consider the fact that the queen can block a knight's movement in a 7x7 sub-grid\nA 7x7 sub-grid can be formed by selecting five rows and two columns, or two rows and five columns. Since a knight can move in an L-shape, a knight can attack a square in a 7x7 sub-grid if it is two squares away horizontally and one square away vertically, or one square away horizontally and two squares away vertically.

During the first part, the players from $X$ arrive one by one, and each newly arrived player immediately plays with everyone already present. During the third part (after all players from $X$ have already departed) the players from $Y$ depart one by one, each playing with everyone still present just before departing.\n\nIn the middle part, everyone from $X$ should play with everyone from $Y$.

Next, we find an optimal permutation and an optimal tournament.\n\nOptimisation for a fixed $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 k}$. We say that the cost of the match between $P_{i}$ and $P_{j}$ is the number of players present at the tournament when this match is played. Clearly, the Committee pays for each day the cost of the match of that day. Hence, we are to minimise the total cost of all matches.\n\nNotice that $Q_{2 k}$ 's departure does not precede $P_{2 k}$ 's arrival. Hence, the number of players at the tournament monotonically increases (non-strictly) until it reaches $2 k$, and then monotonically decreases (non-strictly). So, the best time to schedule the match between $P_{i}$ and $P_{j}$ is either when $P_{\\max (i, j)}$ arrives, or when $Q_{\\max \\left(a_{i}, a_{j}\\right)}$ departs, in which case the cost is $\\min \\left(\\max (i, j), \\max \\left(a_{i}, a_{j}\\right)\\right)$.\n\nConversely, assuming that $i>j$, if this match is scheduled between the arrivals of $P_{i}$ and $P_{i+1}$, then its cost will be exactly $i=\\max (i, j)$. Similarly, one can make it cost $\\max \\left(a_{i}, a_{j}\\right)$.

A nonintersecting route of the limp rook consists of a sequence of pairwise different squares that the limp rook can visit in that order by an admissible sequence of moves. Such a non-intersecting route is called cyclic, if the limp rook can, after reaching the last square of the route, move directly to the first square of the route and start over.\n\nHow many squares does the longest possible cyclic, non-intersecting route of a limp rook visit?", "gt_cot": "None", "gt": "996000", "unit": null, "solution": ["First we show that this number is an upper bound for the number of cells a limp rook can visit. To do this we color the cells with four colors $A, B, C$ and $D$ in the following way: for $(i, j) \\equiv(0,0) \\bmod 2$ use $A$, for $(i, j) \\equiv(0,1) \\bmod 2$ use $B$, for $(i, j) \\equiv(1,0) \\bmod 2$ use $C$ and for $(i, j) \\equiv(1,1) \\bmod 2$ use $D$. From an $A$-cell the rook has to move to a $B$-cell or a $C$-cell. In the first case, the order of the colors of the cells visited is given by $A, B, D, C, A, B, D, C, A, \\ldots$, in the second case it is $A, C, D, B, A, C, D, B, A, \\ldots$ Since the route is closed it must contain the same number of cells of each color. There are only $499^{2} A$-cells. In the following we will show that the rook cannot visit all the $A$-cells on its route and hence the maximum possible number of cells in a route is $4 \\cdot\\left(499^{2}-1\\right)$.\n\nAssume that the route passes through every single $A$-cell. Color the $A$-cells in black and white in a chessboard manner, i.e. color any two $A$-cells at distance 2 in different color. Since the number of $A$-cells is odd the rook cannot always alternate between visiting black and white $A$-cells along its route. Hence there are two $A$-cells of the same color which are four rook-steps apart that are visited directly one after the other. Let these two $A$-cells have row and column numbers $(a, b)$ and $(a+2, b+2)$ respectively.\n\n<img_3906>\n\nThere is up to reflection only one way the rook can take from $(a, b)$ to $(a+2, b+2)$. Let this way be $(a, b) \\rightarrow(a, b+1) \\rightarrow(a+1, b+1) \\rightarrow(a+1, b+2) \\rightarrow(a+2, b+2)$. Also let without loss of generality the color of the cell $(a, b+1)$ be $B$ (otherwise change the roles of columns and rows).\n\nNow consider the $A$-cell $(a, b+2)$. The only way the rook can pass through it is via $(a-1, b+2) \\rightarrow$ $(a, b+2) \\rightarrow(a, b+3)$ in this order, since according to our assumption after every $A$-cell the rook passes through a $B$-cell.

This is due to the following fact:\n\nThe path from $(a, b)$ to $(a, b+3)$ together with the line segment joining these two cells form a closed loop that has one of the cells $(a-1, b+2)$ and $(a+2, b+2)$ in its inside and the other one on the outside.

Similarly we must have $a_{4}$ odd as well. But then $a_{3}^{2}+1$ is a product of two even numbers $\\left(a_{2}+1\\right)\\left(a_{4}+1\\right)$ and thus is divisible by 4 , which is a contradiction as for odd $a_{3}$ we have $a_{3}^{2}+1 \\equiv 2 \\bmod 4$.\n\nHence $a_{2}$ is even.

(This is a well-known formula expressing the area of triangle $A B C$ when $A$ is the origin.)\n\nTo say that there exist integers $x, y$ for which $|u y-v x|=2 k$, is equivalent to saying that the greatest common divisor of $u$ and $v$ is also a divisor of $2 k$. Summing up, a point $B=(u, v) \\in S$ is a $k$-friend of $(0,0)$ if and only if $\\operatorname{gcd}(u, v)$ divides $2 k$.\n\nTranslation by a vector with integer coordinates does not affect $k$-friendship; if two points are $k$-friends, so are their translates. It follows that two points $A, B \\in S, A=(s, t), B=(u, v)$, are $k$-friends if and only if the point $(u-s, v-t)$ is a $k$-friend of $(0,0)$; i.e., if $\\operatorname{gcd}(u-s, v-t) \\mid 2 k$.\n\nLet $n$ be a positive integer which does not divide $2 k$. We claim that a $k$-clique cannot have more than $n^{2}$ elements.\n\nIndeed, all points $(x, y) \\in S$ can be divided into $n^{2}$ classes determined by the remainders that $x$ and $y$ leave in division by $n$. If a set $T$ has more than $n^{2}$ elements, some two points $A, B \\in T, A=(s, t), B=(u, v)$, necessarily fall into the same class. This means that $n \\mid u-s$ and $n \\mid v-t$. Hence $n \\mid d$ where $d=\\operatorname{gcd}(u-s, v-t)$. And since $n$ does not divide $2 k$, also $d$ does not divide $2 k$. Thus $A$ and $B$ are not $k$-friends and the set $T$ is not a $k$-clique.\n\nNow let $M(k)$ be the least positive integer which does not divide $2 k$. Write $M(k)=m$ for the moment and consider the set $T$ of all points $(x, y)$ with $0 \\leq x, y<m$. There are $m^{2}$ of them. If $A=(s, t), B=(u, v)$ are two distinct points in $T$ then both differences $|u-s|,|v-t|$ are integers less than $m$ and at least one of them is positive. By the definition of $m$, every positive integer less than $m$ divides $2 k$. Therefore $u-s$ (if nonzero) divides $2 k$, and the same is true of $v-t$. So $2 k$ is divisible by $\\operatorname{gcd}(u-s, v-t)$, meaning that $A, B$ are $k$-friends. Thus $T$ is a $k$-clique.\n\nIt follows that the maximum size of a $k$-clique is $M(k)^{2}$, with $M(k)$ defined as above.

The same construction works for $n=5 k+4$ and $n=5 k+5$ with $k \\geq 0$. In these cases the required number $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{2 n-1}{5}\\right\\rfloor$ of pairs equals $2 k+1$ again, and the numbers in the table do not exceed $5 k+3$. In the case $n=5 k+2$ with $k \\geq 0$ one needs only $2 k$ pairs. They can be obtained by ignoring the last column of the table (thus removing $5 k+3$ ).

She passes every chosen coin to an adjacent box.\n\nPlayer $A$ 's goal is to ensure at least 1 coin in each box after every move of hers, regardless of how $B$ plays and how many moves are made.

For $n=2012$ this gives $N_{\\min }=4022$.\n\na) If $N=2 n-2$ player $A$ can achieve her goal. Let her start the game with a regular distribution: $n-2$ boxes with 2 coins and 2 boxes with 1 coin. Call the boxes of the two kinds red and white respectively. We claim that on her first move $A$ can achieve a regular distribution again, regardless of $B$ 's first move $M$. She acts according as the following situation $S$ occurs after $M$ or not: The initial distribution contains a red box $R$ with 2 white neighbors, and $R$ receives no coins from them on move $M$.\n\nSuppose that $S$ does not occur. Exactly one of the coins $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$ in a given red box $X$ is involved in $M$, say $c_{1}$. If $M$ passes $c_{1}$ to the right neighbor of $X$, let $A$ pass $c_{2}$ to its left neighbor, and vice versa. By doing so with all red boxes $A$ performs a legal move $M^{\\prime}$. Thus $M$ and $M^{\\prime}$ combined move the 2 coins of every red box in opposite directions. Hence after $M$ and $M^{\\prime}$ are complete each neighbor of a red box $X$ contains exactly 1 coin that was initially in $X$. So each box with a red neighbor is non-empty after $M^{\\prime}$. If initially there is a box $X$ with 2 white neighbors ( $X$ is red and unique) then $X$ receives a coin from at least one of them on move $M$ since $S$ does not occur. Such a coin is not involved in $M^{\\prime}$, so $X$ is also non-empty after $M^{\\prime}$. Furthermore each box $Y$ has given away its initial content after $M$ and $M^{\\prime}$. A red neighbor of $Y$ adds 1 coin to it; a white neighbor adds at most 1 coin because it is not involved in $M^{\\prime}$. Hence each box contains 1 or 2 coins after $M^{\\prime}$. Because $N=2 n-2$, such a distribution is regular.\n\nNow let $S$ occur after move $M$. Then $A$ leaves untouched the exceptional red box $R$. With all remaining red boxes she proceeds like in the previous case, thus making a legal move $M^{\\prime \\prime}$. Box $R$ receives no coins from its neighbors on either move, so there is 1 coin in it after $M^{\\prime \\prime}$. Like above $M$ and $M^{\\prime \\prime}$ combined pass exactly 1 coin from every red box different from $R$ to each of its neighbors. Every box except $R$ has a red neighbor different from $R$, hence all boxes are non-empty after $M^{\\prime \\prime}$. Next, each box $Y$ except $R$ loses its initial content after $M$ and $M^{\\prime \\prime}$. A red neighbor of $Y$ adds at most 1 coin to it; a white neighbor also adds at most 1 coin as it does not participate in $M^{\\prime \\prime}$. Thus each box has 1 or 2 coins after $M^{\\prime \\prime}$, and the obtained distribution is regular.\n\nPlayer $A$ can apply the described strategy indefinitely, so $N=2 n-2$ enables her to succeed.\n\nb) For $N \\leq 2 n-3$ player $B$ can achieve an empty box after some move of $A$. Let $\\alpha$ be a set of $\\ell$ consecutive boxes containing a total of $N(\\alpha)$ coins. We call $\\alpha$ an $\\operatorname{arc}$ if $\\ell \\leq n-2$ and $N(\\alpha) \\leq 2 \\ell-3$. Note that $\\ell \\geq 2$ by the last condition. Moreover if both extremes of $\\alpha$ are non-empty boxes then $N(\\alpha) \\geq 2$, so that $N(\\alpha) \\leq 2 \\ell-3$ implies $\\ell \\geq 3$. Observe also that if an extreme $X$ of $\\alpha$ has more than 1 coin then ignoring $X$ yields a shorter arc. It follows that every arc contains an arc whose extremes have at most 1 coin each.\n\nGiven a clockwise labeling $1,2, \\ldots, n$ of the boxes, suppose that boxes $1,2, \\ldots, \\ell$ form an arc $\\alpha$, with $\\ell \\leq n-2$ and $N(\\alpha) \\leq 2 \\ell-3$. Suppose also that all $n \\geq 7$ boxes are non-empty. Then $B$ can move so that an arc $\\alpha^{\\prime}$ with $N\\left(\\alpha^{\\prime}\\right)<N(\\alpha)$ will appear after any response of $A$.\n\n\n\nOne may assume exactly 1 coin in boxes 1 and $\\ell$ by a previous remark. Let $B$ pass 1 coin in counterclockwise direction from box 1 and box $n$, and in clockwise direction from each remaining box. This leaves $N(\\alpha)-2$ coins in the boxes of $\\alpha$. In addition, due to $3 \\leq \\ell \\leq n-2$, box $\\ell$ has exactly 1 coin $c$, the one received from box $\\ell-1$.\n\nLet player $A$ 's next move $M$ pass $k \\leq 2$ coins to boxes $1,2, \\ldots, \\ell$ from the remaining ones. Only boxes 1 and $\\ell$ can receive such coins, at most 1 each. If $k<2$ then after move $M$ boxes $1,2, \\ldots, \\ell$ form an arc $\\alpha^{\\prime}$ with $N\\left(\\alpha^{\\prime}\\right)<N(\\alpha)$. If $k=2$ then $M$ adds a coin to box $\\ell$. Also $M$ does not move coin $c$ from $\\ell$ because $c$ is involved in the previous move of $B$. In summary boxes $1,2, \\ldots, \\ell$ contain $N(\\alpha)$ coins like before, so they form an arc. However there are 2 coins now in the extreme $\\ell$ of the arc. Ignore $\\ell$ to obtain a shorter arc $\\alpha^{\\prime}$ with $N\\left(\\alpha^{\\prime}\\right)<N(\\alpha)$.\n\nConsider any initial distribution without empty boxes. Since $N \\leq 2 n-3$, there are at least 3 boxes in it with exactly 1 coin. It follows from $n \\geq 7$ that some 2 of them are the extremes of an arc $\\alpha$. Hence $B$ can make the move described above, which leads to an arc $\\alpha^{\\prime}$ with $N\\left(\\alpha^{\\prime}\\right)<N(\\alpha)$ after $A^{\\prime}$ 's response.

If $i=0$, then $n+m$ has color 0 , so $f(n+m)=$ $2(n+m)=2 n+2 m=f(n)+f(m)$. If $i=1$, then $n+m$ has color 2 , so $f(n+m)=n+m=f(n)+f(m)$.

Hence $a$ is odd. We will prove two lemmas.\n\nLemma 1. Any odd integer $b<a$ has a different color than $a$.\n\nProof. Suppose that $b<a$ is an odd integer, and that $a$ and $b$ have the same color. Then on the one hand, $f(a+b)=f(a)+b f(1)$. On the other hand, we also have $f(a+b)=f\\left(\\frac{a+b}{2}\\right)+f\\left(\\frac{a+b}{2}\\right)=(a+b) f(1)$, as $\\frac{a+b}{2}$ is a positive integer smaller than $a$. Hence $f(a)=f(a+b)-b f(1)=(a+b) f(1)-b f(1)=a f(1)$, which is again a contradiction. Therefore all odd integers smaller than $a$ have a color different from that of $a$.\n\nLemma 2. Any even integer $b<a$ has the same color as a\n\nProof. Suppose $b<a$ is an even integer, and that $a$ and $b$ have different colors. Then $a-b$ is an odd integer smaller than $a$, so it has the same color as $b$. Thus $f(a)=f(a-b)+f(b)=(a-b) f(1)+b f(1)=a f(1)$, a contradiction. Hence all even integers smaller than $a$ have the same color as $a$.\n\nSuppose now $a+1$ has the same color as $a$. As $a>1$, we have $\\frac{a+1}{2}<a$ and therefore $f(a+1)=2 f\\left(\\frac{a+1}{2}\\right)=$ $(a+1) f(1)$. As $a-1$ is an even integer smaller than $a$, we have by Lemma 2 that $a-1$ also has the same color as $a$. Hence $2 f(a)=f(2 a)=f(a+1)+f(a-1)=(a+1) f(1)+(a-1) f(1)=2 a f(1)$, which implies that $f(a)=a f(1)$, a contradiction. So $a$ and $a+1$ have different colors.\n\nSince $a-2$ is an odd integer smaller than $a$, by Lemma 1 it has a color different from that of $a$, so $a-2$ and $a+1$ have the same color. Also, we have seen by Lemma 2 that $a-1$ and $a$ have the same color. So $f(a)+f(a-1)=f(2 a-1)=f(a+1)+f(a-2)=(a+1) f(1)+(a-2) f(1)=(2 a-1) f(1)$, from which it follows that $f(a)=(2 a-1) f(1)-f(a-1)=(2 a-1) f(1)-(a-1) f(1)=a f(1)$, which contradicts our choice of $a$ and finishes the proof.", "We prove that $k \\leq 3$ just as in first solution.\n\nNext we show that there is no such function and coloring for $k=2$.\n\nConsider any coloring of $\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ with 2 colors and any function $f: \\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ satisfying conditions (i) and (ii).

For all $l \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ and every $x$ whose color is black, we have $x+l m$ is black and $f(x+\\operatorname{lm})=$ $f(x)+l f(m)$.\n\nProof. We proceed by induction. It is clearly true for $l=0$. If $x+l m$ is black and satisfies $f(x+l m)=$ $f(x)+l f(m)$, then $f(x+(l+1) m)=f(x+l m)+f(m)=f(x)+(l+1) f(m)$ and $f(x+(l+1) m+n)=$ $f(x+l m)+f(m+n)=f(x)+l f(m)+f(m+n) \\neq f(x)+(l+1) f(m)+f(n)=f(x+(l+1) m)+f(n)$, so $x+(l+1) m$ is not the same color of $n$, therefore $x+(l+1) m$ is black. Thjs completes the induction.\n\nIn particular we then must have that $2^{l} n$ is white for every $l$, because otherwise since $2^{l} m$ is black we would have $2^{l} f(m+n)=f\\left(2^{l} m+2^{l} n\\right)=f\\left(2^{l} m\\right)+f\\left(2^{l} n\\right)=2^{l}(f(m)+f(n))$, and consequently $f(m+n)=$ $f(m)+f(n)$.\n\nLemma 5. For every $l \\geq 1,2^{l} m+2^{l-1} n$ is black.\n\n\n\nProof. On the one hand we have $2^{l} f(m+n)=f\\left(2^{l} m+2^{l} n\\right)=f\\left(2^{l-1}(2 m+n)+2^{l-1} n\\right)$. On the other hand we have\n\n$\\left.2^{l} f(m+n)=2^{l-1} \\cdot 2 f(m+n) \\neq 2^{l-1}(f(m+n)+f(m)+f(n))=2^{l-1}(f(2 m+n)+f(n))=f\\left(2^{l} m+2^{l-1} n\\right)\\right)+f\\left(2^{l-1} n\\right)$.\n\nTherefore $2^{l} m+2^{l-1} n$ and $2^{l-1} n$ have different color, which means $2^{l} m+2^{l-1} n$ is black.\n\nCombining the two lemmas give $j m+2^{l-1} n$ is black for all $j \\geq 2^{l}$ and every $l \\geq 1$.\n\nNow write $m=2^{l-1} m^{\\prime}$ with $m^{\\prime}$ odd. Let $t$ be a number such that $\\frac{2^{t}-1}{m^{\\prime}}$ is an integer and $j=\\frac{2^{t}-1}{m^{\\prime}} n \\geq 2^{l}$, i.e. $t$ is some multiple of $\\phi\\left(m^{\\prime}\\right)$. Then we must have that $j m+2^{l-1} n$ is black, but by definition $j m+2^{l-1} n=$ $\\left(2^{t}-1\\right) 2^{l-1} n+2^{l-1} n=2^{t+l-1} n$ is white.

We argue by induction. Let us assume that the Jury can collect $M_{n}$ euros in a configuration with $n$ contestants. Then we show that the Jury can collect at least $2 M_{n}+n$ moves in a configuration with $n+1$ contestants. Indeed, let us begin with all the contestants lined up in reverse order. In the first $M_{n}$ moves the Jury keeps $C_{n+1}$ in first position and reverses the order of the remaining contestants, then in the next $n$ moves all contestants $C_{1}, \\ldots, C_{n}$ (in this order) jump over $C_{n+1}$ and end up in the first $n$ positions of the line in reverse order, and finally in the last $M_{n}$ moves the Jury rearranges the first $n$ positions.\n\nSince $M_{1}=0$ and $M_{n+1} \\geq 2 M_{n}+n$, an easy induction shows that $M_{n} \\geq 2^{n}-n-1$.\n\n<img_3565>\n\nLet us show now that at most $2^{n}-n-1$ moves are possible.

We claim that the total weight decreases after any move of the contestants. Indeed, let us assume that $C_{i}$ moves forward in the queue, let $\\sigma$ be the permutation before the move, and let $\\sigma^{\\prime}$ denote the permutation after the move. Since $C_{i}$ jumps over exactly $i$ contestants, necessarily she jumps over at least one contestant $C_{j}$ with index\n\n\n\n$j>i$. This means that the pair $(i, j)$ is reverse with respect to $\\sigma$ but not with respect to $\\sigma^{\\prime}$, and this yields a reduction of $2^{i}$ in the total weight.

If contestant $C_i$ has fewer than $i$ other contestants in front of her, the process ends. We need to determine the maximum number of euros the Jury can collect by cunningly choosing the initial order and the sequence of moves for every $n$.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the problem\nTo maximize the number of euros collected, the Jury needs to ensure that each contestant pays as much as possible. This means that the Jury should aim to have the maximum number of contestants in front of each $C_i$ before moving her forward. The Jury can achieve this by placing the contestants in a specific order and then making the appropriate moves.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the optimal order\nThe Jury should place the contestants in the order $C_1, C_2, \\ldots, C_n$. This order ensures that when the Jury selects $C_i$, there will be at least $i-1$ contestants in front of her, allowing her to pay one euro and move forward by $i$ positions.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the maximum number of euros collected\nWith the optimal order, the Jury can collect a maximum of $1+2+3+\\ldots+n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ euros.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the case when n is even\nWhen $n$ is even, the Jury can collect an additional euro by placing $C_n$ at the end of the queue. This is because $C_n$ will have $n-1$ contestants in front of her, allowing her to pay one euro and move forward by $n$ positions.\n\n## Step 6: Consider the case when n is odd\nWhen $n$ is odd, the Jury cannot collect an additional euro by placing $C_n$ at the end of the queue. This is because $C_n$ will have $n-1$ contestants in front of her, which is not enough to pay one euro and move forward by $n$ positions.\n\n## Step 7: Determine the maximum number of euros collected for even n\nFor even $n$, the Jury can collect $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2} + 1$ euros.\n\n## Step 8: Determine the maximum number of euros collected for odd n\nFor odd $n$, the Jury can collect $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ euros.\n\n## Step 9: Combine the results\nThe maximum number of euros collected is $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ for odd $n$ and $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2} + 1$ for even $n$.\n\n## Step 10: Simplify the expression\nThe maximum number of euros collected can be simplified to $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ for both odd and even $n$.\n\n## Step 11: Write the final answer in LaTex format\n\\boxed{\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}}\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}}$"], "pred": ["\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

Indeed, if one of the sides the square had three rectangles adjacent to it, removing these three rectangles would leave a polygon with eight vertices, which is clearly not the union of two rectangles. Moreover, since $m>10$, each side of the square has at least two adjacent rectangles. Hence each side of the square has precisely two adjacent rectangles, and thus the only way of partitionning the square into five rectangles is to have a single inner rectangle and four outer rectangles each covering of the four corners of the square, as claimed.\n\nLet us now show that a square of size $12 \\times 12$ cannot be dissected in the desired way. Let $R_{1}, R_{2}, R_{3}$ and $R_{4}$ be the outer rectangles (in clockwise orientation along the\n\n\n\nboundary of the square). If an outer rectangle has a side of length $s$, then some adjacent outer rectangle must have a side of length $12-s$. Therefore, neither of $s=1$ or $s=6$ can be sidelengths of an outer rectangle, so the inner rectangle must have dimensions $1 \\times 6$. One of the outer rectangles (say $R_{1}$ ) must have dimensions $10 \\times x$, and an adjacent rectangle (say $R_{2}$ ) must thus have dimensions $2 \\times y$. Rectangle $R_{3}$ then has dimensions $(12-y) \\times z$, and rectangle $R_{4}$ has dimensions $(12-z) \\times(12-x)$. Note that exactly one of the three numbers $x, y, z$ is even (and equals 4 or 8 ), while the other two numbers are odd. Now, the total area of all five rectangles is\n\n$$\n144=6+10 x+2 y+(12-y) z+(12-z)(12-x)\n$$\n\nwhich simplifies to $(y-x)(z-2)=6$. As exactly one of the three numbers $x, y, z$ is even, the factors $y-x$ and $z-2$ are either both even or both odd, so their product cannot equal 6 , and thus there is no solution with $m=12$.\n\nFinally, we handle the cases $m=11$ and $m=13$, which indeed are solutions. The corresponding rectangle sets are $10 \\times 5,1 \\times 9,8 \\times 2,7 \\times 4$ and $3 \\times 6$ for $m=11$, and $10 \\times 5,9 \\times 8,4 \\times 6,3 \\times 7$ and $1 \\times 2$ for $m=13$.

Clearly there are 2 independent choices for each of the first $k-1$ letters and 1 for the last letter, and since exactly one string is excluded, there must be exactly $2^{k-1}-1$ strings in this set.\n\nSuppose Lexi tries to fill her grid. For each row to have a valid string, it must end in a $B$. But then the right column would necessarily contain $k B \\mathrm{~s}$, and not be in our set. Thus, Lexi cannot fill her grid with our set, and we must have $m \\geqslant 2^{k-1}$.\n\nNow, consider any set $\\mathcal{S}$ with at least $2^{k-1}$ strings. Clearly, if $\\mathcal{S}$ contained either the uniform string with $k A \\mathrm{~s}$ or the string with $k B \\mathrm{~s}$, then Lexi could fill her grid with all of the relevant letters and each row and column would contain that string.\n\nConsider the case where $\\mathcal{S}$ contains neither of those strings.

Clearly, the string with all $A$ s is paired with the string with all $B$ s.

Then by construction the string in this row/column contains $A \\mathrm{~s}$ at indices $k$ with $k \\in \\mathcal{J}$ and $B$ s elsewhere, and thus is precisely $\\ell$.

Simplifying this yields $3b^2 + 6b + 5 = 2b^2 + 14b + 25$.\n\n## Step 8: Solve the first equation for a\nRearranging the terms in the first equation gives $a^2 - 8a - 20 = 0$. This is a quadratic equation in $a$.\n\n## Step 9: Solve the second equation for b\nRearranging the terms in the second equation gives $b^2 - 8b - 20 = 0$. This is a quadratic equation in $b$.\n\n## Step 10: Solve the quadratic equations\nSolving the quadratic equation $a^2 - 8a - 20 = 0$ gives $a = \\frac{-(-8) \\pm \\sqrt{(-8)^2 - 4(1)(-20)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 + 80}}{2} = \\frac{8 \\pm \\sqrt{144}}{2} = \\frac{8 \\pm 12}{2}$. This gives two possible values for $a$: $a = \\frac{8 + 12}{2} = 10$ and $a = \\frac{8 - 12}{2} = -2$.\n\n## Step 11: Solve the quadratic equations\nSolving the quadratic equation $b^2 - 8b - 20 = 0$ gives $b = \\frac{-(-8) \\pm \\sqrt{(-8)^2 - 4(1)(-20)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 + 80}}{2} = \\frac{8 \\pm \\sqrt{144}}{2} = \\frac{8 \\pm 12}{2}$. This gives two possible values for $b$: $b = \\frac{8 + 12}{2} = 10$ and $b = \\frac{8 - 12}{2} = -2$.\n\n## Step 12: Check the solutions\nWe need to check which of these values of $a$ and $b$ give valid sequences of five consecutive integers that satisfy the original condition.\n\n## Step 13: Check the first sequence\nFor $a = 10$, the sequence is $10, 11, 12, 13, 14$. The sum of the squares of the first three integers is $10^2 + 11^2 + 12^2 = 100 + 121 + 144 = 365$ and the sum of the squares of the last two integers is $13^2 + 14^2 = 169 + 196 = 365$. This sequence satisfies the condition.\n\n## Step 14: Check the second sequence\nFor $a = -2$, the sequence is $-2, -1, 0, 1, 2$. The sum of the squares of the first three integers is $(-2)^2 + (-1)^2 + 0^2 = 4 + 1 + 0 = 5$ and the sum of the squares of the last two integers is $1^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 4 = 5$. This sequence also satisfies the condition.\n\n## Step 15: Check the second sequence\nFor $b = 10$, the sequence is $10, 11, 12, 13, 14$. The sum of the squares of the first three integers is $10^2 + 11^2 + 12^2 = 100 + 121 + 144 = 365$ and the sum of the squares of the last two integers is $13^2 + 14^2 = 169 + 196 = 365$. This sequence satisfies the condition.\n\n## Step 16: Check the second sequence\nFor $b = -2$, the sequence is $-2, -1, 0, 1, 2$. The sum of the squares of the first three integers is $(-2)^2 + (-1)^2 + 0^2 = 4 + 1 + 0 = 5$ and the sum of the squares of the last two integers is $1^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 4 = 5$. This sequence also satisfies the condition.\n\n## Step 17: Determine the final answer\nWe have found two valid sequences that satisfy the condition: $10, 11, 12, 13, 14$ and $-2, -1, 0, 1, 2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\left( 10, \\  11, \\  12, \\  13, \\  14\\right), \\left( -2, \\  -1, \\  0, \\  1, \\  2\\right)}$"], "pred": ["(10,\\11,\\12,\\13,\\14),(-2,\\-1,\\0,\\1,\\2)"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

(For example, for the arrangement 14 , the digit 1 is in the leftmost position and the digit 4 can be in any of the remaining $n-1$ positions.) We fill the rest of the positions with 0s. The number of possible integers in each case will be $a b$, since this method will create all such integers and for each of the $a$ arrangements of the non-zero digits, there will be $b$ ways of arranging the digits after the first one. We make a chart to summarize the cases, expanding each total and writing it as a fraction with denominator 24 :\n\n| Case | $a$ | $b$ | $a b$ (expanded) |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |\n| 5 | 1 | 1 | $1=\\frac{24}{24}$ |\n| 4,1 | 2 | $(n-1)$ | $2(n-1)=\\frac{48 n-48}{24}$ |\n| 3,2 | 2 | $(n-1)$ | $2(n-1)=\\frac{48 n-48}{24}$ |\n| $3,1,1$ | 3 | $(<<f17031409419463268>>$)$ | $3(<<f170314094194688001>>$)=\\frac{36 n^{2}-108 n+72}{24}$ |\n| $2,2,1$ | 3 | $(<<f170314094194618352>>$)$ | $3(<<f170314094194638371>>$)=\\frac{36 n^{2}-108 n+72}{24}$ |\n| $2,1,1,1$ | 4 | $(<<f170314094194693288>>$)$ | $4(<<f17031409419469862>>$)=\\frac{16 n^{3}-96 n^{2}+176 n-96}{24}$ |\n| $1,1,1,1,1$ | 1 | $(<<f170314094194686986>>$)$ | $(<<f17031409419465818>>$)=\\frac{n^{4}-10 n^{3}+35 n^{2}-50 n+24}{24}$ |\n\n(Note that in the second and third cases we need $n \\geq 2$, in the fourth and fifth cases we need $n \\geq 3$, in the sixth case we need $n \\geq 4$, and the seventh case we need $n \\geq 5$.

Note also that we say $b=1$ in the first case since there is exactly 1 way of placing $0 \\mathrm{~s}$ in all of the remaining $n-1$ positions.)\n\n$f(n)$ is then the sum of the expressions in the last column of this table, and so\n\n$$\nf(n)=\\frac{n^{4}+6 n^{3}+11 n^{2}+6 n}{24}=\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{24}\n$$\n\nas required.\n\nMethod 2\n\nFirst, we create a correspondence between each integer with $n$ digits and whose digits have\n\n\n\na sum of 5 and an arrangement of five 1 s and $(n-1)$ Xs that begins with a 1 .\n\nWe can then count these integers by counting the arrangements.\n\nStarting with such an integer, we write down an arrangement of the above type using the following rule:\n\nThe number of 1 s to the left of the first $\\mathrm{X}$ is the first digit of the number, the number of 1 s between the first $\\mathrm{X}$ and second $\\mathrm{X}$ is the second digit of the number, and so on, with the number of 1 s to the right of the $(n-1)$ st $\\mathrm{X}$ representing the $n$th digit of the number.\n\nFor example, the integer 1010020001 would correspond to 1XX1XXX11XXXX1.\n\nIn this way, each such integer gives an arrangement of the above type.\n\nSimilarly, each arrangement of this type can be associated back to a unique integer with the required properties by counting the number of 1 s before the first $\\mathrm{X}$ and writing this down as the leftmost digit, counting the number of 1 s between the first and second Xs and writing this down as the second digit, and so on. Since a total of five 1s are used, then each arrangement corresponds with an integer with $n$ digits whose digits have a sum of 5 . Therefore, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the integers and arrangements with the desired properties.\n\nThus, $f(n)$, which equals the number of such integers, also equals the number of such arrangements.\n\nTo count the number of such arrangements, we note that there are four 1 s and $n-1 \\mathrm{Xs}$ to arrange in the final $4+(n-1)=n+3$ positions, since the first position is occupied by a 1 .\n\nThere are $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+3 \\\\ 4\\end{array}\\right)$ ways to choose the positions of the remaining four 1s, and so $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+3 \\\\ 4\\end{array}\\right)$ arrangements.\n\nThus, $f(n)=\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+3 \\\\ 4\\end{array}\\right)=\\frac{(n+3) !}{4 !(n-1) !}=\\frac{(n+3)(n+2)(n+1)(n)}{4 !}=\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{24}$.\n\nNext, we need to determine the positive integers $n$ between 1 and 2014, inclusive, for which the units digit of $f(n)$ is 1 .\n\nNow $f(n)=\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{24}$ is an integer for all positive integers $n$, since it is counting the number of things with a certain property.\n\nIf the units digit of $n$ is 0 or 5 , then $n$ is a multiple of 5 .\n\nIf the units digit of $n$ is 2 or 7 , then $n+3$ is a multiple of 5 .\n\nIf the units digit of $n$ is 3 or 8 , then $n+2$ is a multiple of 5 .\n\nIf the units digit of $n$ is 4 or 9 , then $n+1$ is a multiple of 5 .\n\nThus, if the units digit of $n$ is $0,2,3,4,5,7,8$, or 9 , then $n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)$\n\nis a multiple of 5 and so $f(n)=\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{24}$ is a multiple of 5 , since the denominator contains no factors of 5 that can divide the factor from the numerator.\n\nTherefore, if the units digit of $n$ is $0,2,3,4,5,7,8$, or 9 , then $f(n)$ is divisible by 5 , and so cannot have a units digit of 1 .\n\nSo we consider the cases where $n$ has a units digit of 1 or of 6 ; these are the only possible values of $n$ for which $f(n)$ can have a units digit of 1 .\n\nWe note that $3 f(n)=\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{8}$, which is a positive integer for all positive integers $n$.\n\n\n\nAlso, we note that if $f(n)$ has units digit 1 , then $3 f(n)$ has units digit 3 , and if $3 f(n)$ has units digit 3 , then $f(n)$ must have units digit 1 .\n\nTherefore, determining the values of $n$ for which $f(n)$ has units digit 1 is equivalent to determining the values of $n$ for which $\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{8}$ has units digit 3 .\n\nWe consider the integers $n$ in groups of 40 . (Intuitively, we do this because the problem seems to involve multiples of 5 and multiples of 8 , and $5 \\times 8=40$.)\n\nIf $n$ has units digit 1 , then $n=40 k+1$ or $n=40 k+11$ or $n=40 k+21$ or $n=40 k+31$ for some integer $k \\geq 0$.\n\nIf $n$ has units digit 6 , then $n=40 k+6$ or $n=40 k+16$ or $n=40 k+26$ or $n=40 k+36$ for some integer $k \\geq 0$.\n\nIf $n=40 k+1$, then\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n3 f(n) & =\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{8} \\\\\n& =\\frac{(40 k+1)(40 k+2)(40 k+3)(40 k+4)}{8} \\\\\n& =(40 k+1)(20 k+1)(40 k+3)(10 k+1)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe units digit of $40 k+1$ is 1 , the units digit of $20 k+1$ is 1 , the units digit of $40 k+3$ is 3 , and the units digit of $10 k+1$ is 1 , so the units digit of the product is the units digit of $(1)(1)(3)(1)$ or 3.\n\nIn a similar way, we treat the remaining seven cases and summarize all eight cases in a chart:\n\n| $n$ | $3 f(n)$ simplified | Units digit of $3 f(n)$ |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $40 k+1$ | $(40 k+1)(20 k+1)(40 k+3)(10 k+1)$ | 3 |\n| $40 k+11$ | $(40 k+11)(10 k+3)(40 k+13)(20 k+7)$ | 3 |\n| $40 k+21$ | $(40 k+21)(20 k+11)(40 k+23)(10 k+6)$ | 8 |\n| $40 k+31$ | $(40 k+31)(10 k+8)(40 k+33)(20 k+17)$ | 8 |\n| $40 k+6$ | $(20 k+3)(40 k+7)(10 k+2)(40 k+9)$ | 8 |\n| $40 k+16$ | $(10 k+4)(40 k+17)(20 k+9)(40 k+19)$ | 8 |\n| $40 k+26$ | $(20 k+13)(40 k+27)(10 k+7)(40 k+29)$ | 3 |\n| $40 k+36$ | $(10 k+9)(40 k+37)(20 k+19)(40 k+39)$ | 3 |\n\n(Note that, for example, when $n=40 k+16$, the simplified version of $3 f(n)$ is $(10 k+4)(40 k+17)(20 k+9)(40 k+19)$, so the units digit of $3 f(n)$ is the units digit of $(4)(7)(9)(9)$ which is the units digit of 2268 , or 8 .)\n\nTherefore, $f(n)$ has units digit 1 whenever $n=40 k+1$ or $n=40 k+11$ or $n=40 k+26$ or $n=40 k+36$ for some integer $k \\geq 0$.\n\nThere are 4 such integers $n$ between each pair of consecutive multiples of 40 .\n\nSince $2000=50 \\times 40$, then 2000 is the 50 th multiple of 40 , so there are $50 \\times 4=200$ integers $n$ less than 2000 for which the units digit of $f(n)$ is 1 .\n\nBetween 2000 and 2014, inclusive, there are two additional integers: $n=40(50)+1=2001$ and $n=40(50)+11=2011$.\n\nIn total, 202 of the integers $f(1), f(2), \\ldots, f(2014)$ have a units digit of 1 ."], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Number Theory", "code": ["## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are given a function $f(n)$ that represents the number of positive integers with exactly $n$ digits whose digits sum up to 5.

This means that $b \\leq c \\leq m-1$, so $a=2 m-b-c \\geq 2$. Therefore, $a-1, b-1$ and $c-1$ are positive integers since $a, b$ and $c$ are positive integers with $2 \\leq a \\leq b \\leq c$.\n* Since $2 \\leq a \\leq b \\leq c$, then $1 \\leq a-1 \\leq b-1 \\leq c-1$, so $0<a-1 \\leq b-1 \\leq c-1$.\n* Since $a+b+c=2 m$, then $c=2 m-(a+b)$ so $a+b$ and $c$ have the same parity.\n\nSince $c<a+b$, then $c \\leq a+b-2$. (In other words, it cannot be the case that $c=a+b-1$.) Therefore, $c-1 \\leq(a-1)+(b-1)-1$; that is, $c-1<(a-1)+(b-1)$.\n\n$*$ Since $a+b+c=2 m$, then $(a-1)+(b-1)+(c-1)=2 m-3$.\n\nTherefore, $(a-1, b-1, c-1)$ is in $S_{2 m-3}$, since it satisfies all of the conditions of $S_{2 m-3}$. Note as well that two different triples in $S_{2 m}$ correspond to two different triples in $S_{2 m-3}$. Thus, every triple in $S_{2 m}$ corresponds to a different triple in $S_{2 m-3}$.\n\nThus, $T(2 m) \\leq T(2 m-3)$.\n\nConsider a triple $(A, B, C)$ in $S_{2 m-3}$ and a corresponding triple $(A+1, B+1, C+1)$. We show that $(A+1, B+1, C+1)$ is in $S_{2 m}$ :\n\n* Since $(A, B, C)$ is in $S_{2 m-3}$, then $A, B$ and $C$ are positive integers, so $A+1, B+1$ and $C+1$ are positive integers.\n* Since $0<A \\leq B \\leq C$, then $1<A+1 \\leq B+1 \\leq C+1$, so $0<A+1 \\leq B+1 \\leq C+1$.\n* Since $C<A+B$, then $C+1<(A+1)+(B+1)-1$ so $C+1<(A+1)+(B+1)$.\n* Since $A+B+C=2 m-3$, then $(A+1)+(B+1)+(C+1)=2 m$.\n\nTherefore, $(A+1, B+1, C+1)$ is in $S_{2 m}$.\n\nNote again that two different triples in $S_{2 m-3}$ correspond to two different triples in $S_{2 m}$. Thus, every triple in $S_{2 m-3}$ corresponds to a different triple in $S_{2 m}$.\n\nTherefore, $T(2 m-3) \\leq T(2 m)$.\n\nSince $T(2 m) \\leq T(2 m-3)$ and $T(2 m-3) \\leq T(2 m)$, then $T(2 m)=T(2 m-3)$.\n\n\nNext, we prove (F2):\n\nConsider a triple $(a, b, c)$ in $S_{k}$ and a corresponding triple $(a, b+1, c+1)$. We show that the triple $(a, b+1, c+1)$ is in $S_{k+2}$ :\n\n* Since $a, b$ and $c$ are positive integers, then $a, b+1$ and $c+1$ are positive integers.\n\n\n\n* Since $0<a \\leq b \\leq c$, then $0<a \\leq b+1 \\leq c+1$.\n* Since $c<a+b$, then $c+1<a+(b+1)$.\n\n$*$ Since $a+b+c=k$, then $a+(b+1)+(c+1)=k+2$.\n\nTherefore, $(a, b+1, c+1)$ is in $S_{k+2}$. Note that, using this correspondence, different triples in $S_{k}$ correspond different triples in $S_{k+2}$. Thus, every triple in $S_{k}$ corresponds to a different triple in $S_{k+2}$. This proves that $T(k) \\leq T(k+2)$.\n\nSuppose that $n=N$ is the smallest positive integer for which $T(n)>2010$.\n\nThen $N$ must be odd:\n\nIf $N$ was even, then by (F1), $T(N-3)=T(N)>2010$ and so $n=N-3$ would be an integer smaller than $N$ with $T(n)>2010$. This contradicts the fact that $n=N$ is the smallest such integer.\n\nTherefore, we want to find the smallest odd positive integer $N$ for which $T(N)>2010$. Next, we note that if we can find an odd positive integer $n$ such that $T(n)>2010 \\geq$ $T(n-2)$, then we will have found the desired value of $n$ :\n\nThis is because $n$ and $n-2$ are both odd, and by property (F2), any smaller odd positive integer $k$ will give $T(k) \\leq T(n-2) \\leq 2010$ and any larger odd positive integer $m$ will give $T(m) \\geq T(n)>2010$.\n\nWe show that $N=309$ is the desired value of $N$ by showing that $T(309)>2010$ and $T(307) \\leq 2010$.\n\nCalculation of $T(309)$\n\nWe know that $\\frac{309}{3} \\leq c<\\frac{309}{2}$, so $103 \\leq c \\leq 154$.\n\nFor each admissible value of $c$, we need to count the number of pairs of positive integers $(a, b)$ with $a \\leq b \\leq c$ and $a+b=309-c$.\n\nFor example, if $c=154$, then we need $a \\leq b \\leq 154$ and $a+b=155$.\n\nThis gives pairs $(1,154),(2,153), \\ldots,(76,79),(77,78)$, of which there are 77 .\n\nAlso, if $c=153$, then we need $a \\leq b \\leq 153$ and $a+b=156$.\n\nThis gives pairs $(3,153), \\ldots,(77,79),(78,78)$, of which there are 76 .\n\nIn general, if $c$ is even, then the minimum possible value of $a$ occurs when $b$ is as large as possible - that is, when $b=c$, so $a \\geq 309-2 c$.\n\nAlso, the largest possible value of $a$ occurs when $a$ and $b$ are as close to equal as possible. Since $c$ is even, then $309-c$ is odd, so $a$ and $b$ cannot be equal, but they can differ by 1 . In this case, $a=154-\\frac{1}{2} c$ and $b=155-\\frac{1}{2} c$.\n\nTherefore, if $c$ is even, there are $\\left(154-\\frac{1}{2} c\\right)-(309-2 c)+1=\\frac{3}{2} c-154$ possible pairs $(a, b)$ and so $\\frac{3}{2} c-154$ possible triples.\n\nIn general, if $c$ is odd, then the minimum possible value of $a$ occurs when $b$ is as large as possible - that is, when $b=c$, so $a \\geq 309-2 c$.\n\nAlso, the largest possible value of $a$ occurs when $a$ and $b$ are as close to equal as possible.\n\nSince $c$ is odd, then $309-c$ is even, so $a$ and $b$ can be equal.

We are asked to determine the values of $x$, $y$, and $z$ for team E.\n## Step 2:  To start, we need to understand the total number of games played by each team. Since each team plays 5 games with each of the other 4 teams, the total number of games played by each team is 20.\n## Step 3:  We can use the fact that the total number of games played by each team is the sum of their wins, losses, and ties. This gives us the equation $x + y + z = 20$ for team E.\n## Step 4:  Additionally, we know that the total number of wins for all teams must be equal to the total number of losses for all teams, as each game results in one win and one loss. This gives us the equation $2 + 7 + 6 + 10 + x = 15 + 9 + 12 + 8 + y$.\n## Step 5:  Simplifying this equation, we get $25 + x = 44 + y$, which can be further simplified to $x - y = 19$.\n## Step 6:  We also know that the total number of ties for all teams must be equal to the sum of the ties for each team, which gives us the equation $3 + 4 + 2 + 2 + z = 15 + 9 + 12 + 8 + y$.\n## Step 7:  Simplifying this equation, we get $11 + z = 44 + y$, which can be further simplified to $z - y = 33$.\n## Step 8:  Now we have a system of two equations: $x - y = 19$ and $z - y = 33$.

Thus, an $\\operatorname{ESO}(2 k)$ cannot include $2 k$, since it would then have to include a larger odd positive integer, which it cannot. Therefore, an $\\operatorname{ESO}(2 k)$ has largest term at most $2 k-1$ and so is an $\\operatorname{ESO}(2 k-1)$.

Note that every $\\operatorname{ESE}(2 k-1)$ is an $\\operatorname{ESE}(2 k)$.\n\nTherefore, the number of sequences in this case is $A(2 k-1)$.\n\nThus, $A(2 k)=A(2 k-1)+B(2 k-1)$.\n\n(iv) $\\operatorname{An} \\operatorname{ESO}(2 k+1)$ is either the one term sequence $2 k+1$, or includes $2 k+1$ and more terms, or does not include $2 k+1$.\n\nThere is 1 sequence of the first kind.\n\nAs in (iii), there are $A(2 k)$ sequences of the second kind and $B(2 k)$ sequences of the third kind.\n\nThus, $B(2 k+1)=1+A(2 k)+B(2 k)$.\n\nCombining these facts, for each positive integer $k$, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ne(2 k+1) & =A(2 k+1)+B(2 k+1) \\\\\n& =A(2 k)+(A(2 k)+B(2 k)+1) \\\\\n& =(A(2 k)+B(2 k))+A(2 k)+1 \\\\\n& =e(2 k)+(A(2 k-1)+B(2 k-1))+1 \\\\\n& =e(2 k)+e(2 k-1)+1\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ne(2 k) & =A(2 k)+B(2 k) \\\\\n& =(A(2 k-1)+B(2 k-1))+B(2 k-1) \\\\\n& =e(2 k-1)+(A(2 k-2)+B(2 k-2)+1) \\\\\n& =e(2 k-1)+e(2 k-2)+1\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTherefore, for all positive integers $n \\geq 3$, we have $e(n)=e(n-1)+e(n-2)+1$, as required.\n\n\n\nMethod 2 \n\nLet $n$ be a positive integer with $n \\geq 3$, and consider the $\\operatorname{ES}(n)$.\n\nWe divide the sequences into three sets:\n\n(i) The sequence 1 (there is 1 such sequence)\n\n(ii) The sequences which begin with 1 and have more than 1 term\n\n(iii) The sequences which do not begin with 1\n\nWe show that in case (ii) there are $e(n-1)$ sequences and in case (iii) there are $e(n-2)$ sequences.

Each of the resulting sequences is distinct, includes numbers from the set $\\{1,2,3, \\ldots, n-1\\}$, is increasing, and has odd terms in odd positions and even terms in even positions (since each term has been reduced by 1). Also, each sequence in $R$ can be obtained in this way (since adding 1 to each term in one of these ES gives a distinct sequence in $Q$ ).\n\nTherefore, the number of sequences in this case is $e(n-1)$.\n\n(iii) Consider the set of $\\operatorname{ES}(n)$ that do not begin with 1 . We call this set of sequences $T$. Since each sequence in $T$ does not begin with 1 , then the minimum number in each sequence is 3 .\n\nThus, each of the sequences in $T$ includes numbers from the set $\\{3,4, \\ldots, n\\}$, is increasing, and has odd terms in odd positions and even terms in even positions.\n\nThe sequences in $T$ are in a one-to-one correspondence with the $\\mathrm{ES}(n-2)$ (we call this set of sequences $U$ ) and so there are exactly $e(n-2)$ of them.\n\nWe can show that this one-to-one correspondence exists by subtracting 2 from each term of each sequence in $T$, to form a set of sequences $V$. Each of the resulting sequences is distinct, includes numbers from the set $\\{1,2,3, \\ldots, n-2\\}$, is increasing, and has odd terms in odd positions and even terms in even positions (since each term has been reduced by 2). Also, each sequence in $U$ can be obtained in this way (since adding 2 to each term in one of these $\\mathrm{ES}$ gives a distinct sequence in $U$ ).\n\nTherefore, the number of sequences in this case is $e(n-2)$.\n\nThis concludes our proof and shows that $e(n)=1+e(n-1)+e(n-2)$, as required."], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Combinatorics", "code": ["## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the conditions for an Eden sequence and how the number of such sequences changes as we move from one set of consecutive integers to the next.\n## Step 2:  We are given that for each positive integer $N$, an Eden sequence from $\\{1,2,3, \\ldots, N\\}$ is a sequence that satisfies three conditions: each term is an element of the set of consecutive integers $\\{1,2,3, \\ldots, N\\}$, the sequence is increasing, and the terms in odd-numbered positions are odd and the terms in even-numbered positions are even.\n## Step 3:  We are also given that $e(17)=4180$ and $e(20)=17710$, and we need to determine $e(18)$ and $e(19)$.\n## Step 4:  To approach this problem, we can use the given information to establish a relationship between the number of Eden sequences for consecutive values of $N$.\n## Step 5:  We can start by considering the relationship between the number of Eden sequences for $N$ and $N+1$.

Determine the probability that Amir wins the game.", "gt_cot": "None", "gt": "\\frac{7}{15}", "unit": null, "solution": ["On her first two turns, Brigitte either chooses two cards of the same colour or two cards of different colours. If she chooses two cards of different colours, then on her third turn, she must choose a card that matches one of the cards that she already has.\n\nTherefore, the game ends on or before Brigitte's third turn.\n\nThus, if Amir wins, he wins on his second turn or on his third turn. (He cannot win on his first turn.)\n\nFor Amir to win on his second turn, the second card he chooses must match the first card that he chooses.\n\nOn this second turn, there will be 5 cards in his hand, of which 1 matches the colour of the first card that he chose.\n\nTherefore, the probability that Amir wins on his second turn is $\\frac{1}{5}$.\n\nNote that there is no restriction on the first card that he chooses or the first card that Brigitte chooses.\n\nFor Amir to win on his third turn, the following conditions must be true: (i) the colour of the second card that he chooses is different from the colour of the first card that he chooses, (ii) the colour of the second card that Brigitte chooses is different from the colour of the first card that she chooses, and (iii) the colour of the third card that Amir chooses matches the colour of one of the first two cards.\n\nThe probability of (i) is $\\frac{4}{5}$, since he must choose any card other than the one that matches the first one.\n\nThe probability of (ii) is $\\frac{2}{3}$, since Brigitte must choose either of the cards that does not match her first card.\n\nThe probability of (iii) is $\\frac{2}{4}$, since Amir can choose either of the 2 cards that matches one of the first two cards that he chose.\n\nAgain, the cards that Amir and Brigitte choose on their first turns do not matter.\n\nThus, the probability that Amir wins on his third turn is $\\frac{4}{5} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{2}{4}$ which equals $\\frac{4}{15}$.\n\nFinally, the probabilty that Amir wins the game is thus $\\frac{1}{5}+\\frac{4}{15}$ which equals $\\frac{7}{15}$."], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Combinatorics", "code": ["## Step 1: Determine the possible ways Amir can win the game\nAmir can win the game by placing two cards of the same color on the table. Since Amir starts with 2 red, 2 yellow, and 2 green cards, he can win the game by placing two red cards, two yellow cards, or two green cards.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the probability of Amir winning with two red cards\nFor Amir to win with two red cards, he must draw a red card on his first turn and then another red card on his second turn. The probability of drawing a red card on the first turn is 2/6, since there are 2 red cards out of 6 cards in his hand. The probability of drawing a red card on the second turn is 1/5, since there is 1 red card left out of 5 cards remaining in his hand. Therefore, the probability of Amir winning with two red cards is (2/6) * (1/5) = 1/15.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability of Amir winning with two yellow cards\nSimilarly, for Amir to win with two yellow cards, he must draw a yellow card on his first turn and then another yellow card on his second turn. The probability of drawing a yellow card on the first turn is 2/6, since there are 2 yellow cards out of 6 cards in his hand. The probability of drawing a yellow card on the second turn is 1/5, since there is 1 yellow card left out of 5 cards remaining in his hand. Therefore, the probability of Amir winning with two yellow cards is (2/6) * (1/5) = 1/15.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability of Amir winning with two green cards\nSimilarly, for Amir to win with two green cards, he must draw a green card on his first turn and then another green card on his second turn. The probability of drawing a green card on the first turn is 2/6, since there are 2 green cards out of 6 cards in his hand. The probability of drawing a green card on the second turn is 1/5, since there is 1 green card left out of 5 cards remaining in his hand. Therefore, the probability of Amir winning with two green cards is (2/6) * (1/5) = 1/15.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability of Amir winning the game\nSince Amir can win the game by placing two red cards, two yellow cards, or two green cards, we need to add the probabilities of these three events. Therefore, the probability of Amir winning the game is 1/15 + 1/15 + 1/15 = 3/15 = 1/5.\n\n## Step 6: Consider the cases where Amir wins on his third turn\nIf Amir does not win on his first or second turn, the game continues to his third turn. On his third turn, Amir must draw a card of the same color as one of the cards he has already drawn. The probability of drawing a red card on his third turn is 2/4, since there are 2 red cards out of 4 cards remaining in his hand. The probability of drawing a yellow card on his third turn is 2/4, since there are 2 yellow cards out of 4 cards remaining in his hand. The probability of drawing a green card on his third turn is 2/4, since there are 2 green cards out of 4 cards remaining in his hand. Therefore, the probability of Amir winning with two red cards on his third turn is (2/6) * (1/5) * (2/4) = 1/30. The probability of Amir winning with two yellow cards on his third turn is (2/6) * (1/5) * (2/4) = 1/30. The probability of Amir winning with two green cards on his third turn is (2/6) * (1/5) * (2/4) = 1/30.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the probability of Amir winning the game on his third turn\nSince Amir can win the game on his third turn by placing two red cards, two yellow cards, or two green cards, we need to add the probabilities of these three events. Therefore, the probability of Amir winning the game on his third turn is 1/30 + 1/30 + 1/30 = 3/30 = 1/10.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the probability of Amir winning the game\nSince Amir can win the game on his first, second, or third turn, we need to add the probabilities of these three events. Therefore, the probability of Amir winning the game is 1/5 + 1/10 = 3/10.\n\n## Step 9: Consider the cases where Amir wins on his fourth turn\nIf Amir does not win on his first, second, or third turn, the game continues to his fourth turn. On his fourth turn, Amir must draw a card of the same color as one of the cards he has already drawn. The probability of drawing a red card on his fourth turn is 1/3, since there is 1 red card out of 3 cards remaining in his hand. The probability of drawing a yellow card on his fourth turn is 1/3, since there is 1 yellow card out of 3 cards remaining in his hand. The probability of drawing a green card on his fourth turn is 1/3, since there is 1 green card out of 3 cards remaining in his hand. Therefore, the probability of Amir winning with two red cards on his fourth turn is (2/6) * (1/5) * (1/4) * (1/3) = 1/120. The probability of Amir winning with two yellow cards on his fourth turn is (2/6) * (1/5) * (1/4) * (1/3) = 1/120. The probability of Amir winning with two green cards on his fourth turn is (2/6) * (1/5) * (1/4) * (1/3) = 1/120.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate the probability of Amir winning the game on his fourth turn\nSince Amir can win the game on his fourth turn by placing two red cards, two yellow cards, or two green cards, we need to add the probabilities of these three events. Therefore, the probability of Amir winning the game on his fourth turn is 1/120 + 1/120 + 1/120 = 3/120 = 1/40.\n\n## Step 11: Calculate the probability of Amir winning the game\nSince Amir can win the game on his first, second, third, or fourth turn, we need to add the probabilities of these four events. Therefore, the probability of Amir winning the game is 3/10 + 1/40 = 19/40.\n\n## Step 12: Consider the cases where Amir wins on his fifth turn\nIf Amir does not win on his first, second, third, or fourth turn, the game continues to his fifth turn. On his fifth turn, Amir must draw a card of the same color as one of the cards he has already drawn. The probability of drawing a red card on his fifth turn is 0, since there are no red cards remaining in his hand. The probability of drawing a yellow card on his fifth turn is 0, since there are no yellow cards remaining in his hand. The probability of drawing a green card on his fifth turn is 0, since there are no green cards remaining in his hand.\n\n## Step 13: Calculate the probability of Amir winning the game on his fifth turn\nSince Amir cannot win the game on his fifth turn, the probability of Amir winning the game on his fifth turn is 0.\n\n## Step 14: Calculate the probability of Amir winning the game\nSince Amir can win the game on his first, second, third, or fourth turn, we need to add the probabilities of these four events. Therefore, the probability of Amir winning the game is 19/40.\n\n## Step 15: Consider the cases where Amir wins on his sixth turn\nIf Amir does not win on his first, second, third, fourth, or fifth turn, the game continues to his sixth turn. On his sixth turn, Amir must draw a card of the same color as one of the cards he has already drawn. However, since Amir has already drawn all his cards, this is not possible.\n\n## Step 16: Calculate the probability of Amir winning the game on his sixth turn\nSince Amir cannot win the game on his sixth turn, the probability of Amir winning the game on his sixth turn is 0.\n\n## Step 17: Calculate the probability of Amir winning the game\nSince Amir can win the game on his first, second, third, or fourth turn, we need to add the probabilities of these four events. Therefore, the probability of Amir winning the game is 19/40.\n\n## Step 18: Consider the cases where Amir wins on his seventh turn\nIf Amir does not win on his first, second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth turn, the game continues to his seventh turn. However, since Amir has already drawn all his cards, this is not possible.\n\n## Step 19: Calculate the probability of Amir winning the game on his seventh turn\nSince Amir cannot win the game on his seventh turn, the probability of Amir winning the game on his seventh turn is 0.\n\n## Step 20: Calculate the probability of Amir winning the game\nSince Amir can win the game on his first, second, third, or fourth turn, we need to add the probabilities of these"], "pred": ["20"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

We can use the recurrence relation again to find $u_{5}$ and $u_{6}$ in terms of $u_{2}$ and $u_{3}$.\n\n## Step 4: Using the recurrence relation, we have $u_{5}=3u_{4}-u_{3}$ and $u_{6}=3u_{5}-u_{4}$. We can substitute the expression for $u_{4}$ from the previous step into the expression for $u_{5}$ and then substitute the expression for $u_{5}$ into the expression for $u_{6}$.\n\n## Step 5: After simplifying the expression for $u_{6}$, we can equate it to the given value of $u_{6}=89$ and solve for $u_{2}$.\n\n## Step 6: Once we have the value of $u_{2}$, we can use the recurrence relation to find $u_{4}$ and $u_{5}$.\n\n## Step 7: Finally, we can use the recurrence relation to find $u_{7}$.\n\n## Step 8: Now, let's calculate the value of $u_{2}$. We have $u_{6}=3u_{5}-u_{4}$. We can substitute the expression for $u_{5}$ from the previous step into this equation and simplify to get $u_{6}=3(3u_{3}-u_{2})-u_{4}$.\n\n## Step 9: We can substitute the expression for $u_{4}$ from the previous step into this equation and simplify to get $u_{6}=3(3u_{3}-u_{2})-3u_{3}+u_{2}$.\n\n## Step 10: Simplifying the expression, we get $u_{6}=9u_{3}-3u_{2}-3u_{3}+u_{2}$.\n\n## Step 11: Combining like terms, we get $u_{6}=6u_{3}-2u_{2}$.\n\n## Step 12: We are given that $u_{6}=89$ and $u_{3}=5$. Substituting these values into the equation, we get $89=6(5)-2u_{2}$.\n\n## Step 13: Simplifying the equation, we get $89=30-2u_{2}$.\n\n## Step 14: Subtracting 30 from both sides of the equation, we get $-1=-2u_{2}$.\n\n## Step 15: Dividing both sides of the equation by -2, we get $u_{2}=\\frac{-1}{-2}$.\n\n## Step 16: Simplifying the expression, we get $u_{2}=\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n## Step 17: Now that we have the value of $u_{2}$, we can use the recurrence relation to find $u_{4}$. We have $u_{4}=3u_{3}-u_{2}$.\n\n## Step 18: Substituting the values of $u_{3}=5$ and $u_{2}=\\frac{1}{2}$ into the equation, we get $u_{4}=3(5)-\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n## Step 19: Simplifying the expression, we get $u_{4}=\\frac{15}{2}$.\n\n## Step 20: Now that we have the value of $u_{4}$, we can use the recurrence relation to find $u_{5}$.

Each resident belongs to exactly one group and knows how to make precisely two dishes. We need to find the number of dishes, denoted as $d$, that a full town $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$ can have in terms of the population of the town, denoted as $n$.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the conditions for a full town\nA town $T$ is called full if for every pair of dishes in $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$, there is exactly one resident in $T$ who knows how to make those two dishes. This means that each pair of dishes must be known by exactly one resident.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the relationship between the number of residents and the number of dishes\nSince each resident knows how to make precisely two dishes, we can represent the residents as edges in a graph, where each edge connects two residents who know how to make the same pair of dishes. A full town corresponds to a graph where every pair of residents is connected by exactly one edge.\n\n## Step 4: Use graph theory to find the relationship between the number of residents and the number of dishes\nIn a graph with $n$ vertices (residents), the number of edges (pairs of dishes) is given by the combination formula $\\binom{n}{2}$. However, since each edge represents a pair of dishes known by exactly one resident, we need to find the number of edges that can be formed with $n$ vertices such that each pair of vertices is connected by exactly one edge.\n\n## Step 5: Apply the condition that each resident knows how to make precisely two dishes\nSince each resident knows how to make precisely two dishes, each vertex in the graph has degree 2. This means that the graph is a regular graph with degree 2.\n\n## Step 6: Use the properties of regular graphs to find the relationship between the number of residents and the number of dishes\nA regular graph with degree 2 can be represented as a collection of disjoint cycles. The number of edges in a cycle is equal to the number of vertices in the cycle. Since each edge is counted twice (once for each vertex it connects), the total number of edges in the graph is equal to half the sum of the lengths of all the cycles.\n\n## Step 7: Find the relationship between the number of residents and the number of dishes\nSince each resident knows how to make precisely two dishes, the number of edges in the graph is equal to the number of residents. Let $n$ be the number of residents. Then, the number of edges is $n$. Since each edge is counted twice, the total number of edges is $n$. Since the graph is a collection of disjoint cycles, the number of edges is equal to half the sum of the lengths of all the cycles.\n\n## Step 8: Use the properties of cycles to find the relationship between the number of residents and the number of dishes\nSince each cycle has an even number of vertices, the sum of the lengths of all the cycles is even. Therefore, the number of edges is even. Since the number of edges is equal to $n$, we have $n$ is even.\n\n## Step 9: Find the relationship between the number of residents and the number of dishes\nSince the number of edges is equal to $n$, and each edge represents a pair of dishes, the number of dishes is equal to the number of edges. Therefore, the number of dishes is $n$.\n\n## Step 10: Consider the case where the number of residents is even\nSince the number of residents is even, we can write $n = 2k$ for some integer $k$. Then, the number of dishes is $n = 2k$.\n\n## Step 11: Consider the case where the number of residents is odd\nHowever, if $n$ is odd, then the graph cannot be a collection of disjoint cycles, and the number of edges is not equal to $n$. Therefore, we must have $n$ is even.\n\n## Step 12: Find the final relationship between the number of residents and the number of dishes\nSince $n$ is even, we can write $n = 2k$ for some integer $k$. Then, the number of dishes is $d = n = 2k$.\n\n## Step 13: Express the final answer in terms of n\nSince $d = 2k$ and $n = 2k$, we can express $d$ in terms of $n$ as $d = n$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{n}$"], "pred": ["n"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

The group number of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{gr}(T)$, is the least positive integer $k$ for which there exists a group assignment on $T$.\n\nFor example, consider once again the town of ARMLton. A valid group assignment would be $f($ Paul $)=f($ Kelly $)=1$ and $f($ Arnold $)=2$. The function which gives the value 1 to each resident of ARMLton is not a group assignment, because Paul and Arnold must be assigned to different groups.\n\n\nFor a dish $D$, a resident is called a $D$-chef if he or she knows how to make the dish $D$. Define $\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)$ to be the set of residents in $T$ who are $D$-chefs. For example, in ARMLville, David is a steak-chef and a pancakes-chef.

For example, ARMLton is homogeneous, because $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLton $)=2$ and exactly two chefs make pie, but ARMLville is heterogeneous, because even though each dish is only cooked by two chefs, $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLville $)=3$.\n\n\nA resident cycle is a sequence of distinct residents $r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{n}$ such that for each $1 \\leq i \\leq n-1$, the residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$ know how to make a common dish, residents $r_{n}$ and $r_{1}$ know how to make a common dish, and no other pair of residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}, 1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$ know how to make a common dish. Two resident cycles are indistinguishable if they contain the same residents (in any order), and distinguishable otherwise. For example, if $r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}, r_{4}$ is a resident cycle, then $r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}, r_{3}$ and $r_{3}, r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}$ are indistinguishable resident cycles.\nCompute the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length 6 in $\\mathcal{F}_{8}$.", "gt_cot": "None", "gt": "1680", "unit": null, "solution": ["Because the town is full, each pair of dishes is cooked by exactly one resident, so it is simplest to identify residents by the pairs of dishes they cook.

Adjacent to each name is the list of dishes that the corresponding resident knows how to make.\n\n| ARMLton |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Resident | Dishes |\n| Paul | pie, turkey |\n| Arnold | pie, salad |\n| Kelly | salad, broth |\n\n\n| ARMLville |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Resident | Dishes |\n| Sally | steak, calzones |\n| Ross | calzones, pancakes |\n| David | steak, pancakes |\n\nThe population of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{pop}(T)$, is the number of residents of $T$. Formally, the town itself is simply the set of its residents, denoted by $\\left\\{r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{\\mathrm{pop}(T)}\\right\\}$ unless otherwise specified. The set of dishes that the residents of $T$ collectively know how to make is denoted $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$. For example, in the town of ARMLton described above, pop(ARMLton) $=3$, and dish(ARMLton) $=$ \\{pie, turkey, salad, broth\\}.\n\nA town $T$ is called full if for every pair of dishes in $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$, there is exactly one resident in $T$ who knows how to make those two dishes. In the examples above, ARMLville is a full town, but ARMLton is not, because (for example) nobody in ARMLton knows how to make both turkey and salad.\n\nDenote by $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$ a full town in which collectively the residents know how to make $d$ dishes. That is, $\\left|\\operatorname{dish}\\left(\\mathcal{F}_{d}\\right)\\right|=d$.\n\nIn order to avoid the embarrassing situation where two people bring the same dish to a group dinner, if two people know how to make a common dish, they are forbidden from participating in the same group meeting. Formally, a group assignment on $T$ is a function $f: T \\rightarrow\\{1,2, \\ldots, k\\}$, satisfying the condition that if $f\\left(r_{i}\\right)=f\\left(r_{j}\\right)$ for $i \\neq j$, then $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}$ do not know any of the same recipes. The group number of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{gr}(T)$, is the least positive integer $k$ for which there exists a group assignment on $T$.\n\nFor example, consider once again the town of ARMLton. A valid group assignment would be $f($ Paul $)=f($ Kelly $)=1$ and $f($ Arnold $)=2$. The function which gives the value 1 to each resident of ARMLton is not a group assignment, because Paul and Arnold must be assigned to different groups.\n\n\nFor a dish $D$, a resident is called a $D$-chef if he or she knows how to make the dish $D$. Define $\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)$ to be the set of residents in $T$ who are $D$-chefs. For example, in ARMLville, David is a steak-chef and a pancakes-chef. Further, $\\operatorname{chef}_{\\text {ARMLville }}($ steak $)=\\{$ Sally, David $\\}$.\n\n\nIf $\\operatorname{gr}(T)=\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for some $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called homogeneous. If $\\operatorname{gr}(T)>\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for each dish $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called heterogeneous. For example, ARMLton is homogeneous, because $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLton $)=2$ and exactly two chefs make pie, but ARMLville is heterogeneous, because even though each dish is only cooked by two chefs, $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLville $)=3$.\n\n\nA resident cycle is a sequence of distinct residents $r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{n}$ such that for each $1 \\leq i \\leq n-1$, the residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$ know how to make a common dish, residents $r_{n}$ and $r_{1}$ know how to make a common dish, and no other pair of residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}, 1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$ know how to make a common dish. Two resident cycles are indistinguishable if they contain the same residents (in any order), and distinguishable otherwise. For example, if $r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}, r_{4}$ is a resident cycle, then $r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}, r_{3}$ and $r_{3}, r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}$ are indistinguishable resident cycles.\nIn terms of $k$ and $d$, find the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length $k$ in $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$.", "gt_cot": "None", "gt": "\\frac{}{2k(-k)!}", "unit": null, "solution": ["First, we compute the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length 6 in $\\mathcal{F}_{8}$.\n\nBecause the town is full, each pair of dishes is cooked by exactly one resident, so it is simplest to identify residents by the pairs of dishes they cook. Suppose the first resident cooks $\\left(d_{1}, d_{2}\\right)$, the second resident $\\left(d_{2}, d_{3}\\right)$, the third resident $\\left(d_{3}, d_{4}\\right)$, and so on, until the sixth resident, who cooks $\\left(d_{6}, d_{1}\\right)$. Then there are 8 choices for $d_{1}$ and 7 choices for $d_{2}$. There are only 6 choices for $d_{3}$, because $d_{3} \\neq d_{1}$ (otherwise two residents would cook the same pair of dishes). For $k>3$, the requirement that no two intermediate residents cook the same dishes implies that $d_{k+1}$ cannot equal any of $d_{1}, \\ldots, d_{k-1}$, and of course $d_{k}$ and $d_{k+1}$ must be distinct dishes. Hence there are $8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3=20,160$ six-person resident cycles, not accounting for different starting points in the cycle and the two different directions to go around the cycle. Taking these into account, there are $20,160 /(6 \\cdot 2)=1,680$ distinguishable resident cycles.\n\nUsing the logic above, there are $d(d-1) \\cdots(d-k+1)$ choices for $d_{1}, d_{2}, \\ldots, d_{k}$. To account for indistinguishable cycles, divide by $k$ possible starting points and 2 possible directions, yielding $\\frac{d(d-1) \\cdots(d-k+1)}{2 k}$ or $\\frac{d !}{2 k(d-k) !}$ distinguishable resident cycles."], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Combinatorics", "code": ["## Step 1: Understand the problem and the given information\nWe are given a problem about a town in ARMLandia where residents form groups to share math problems and enjoy each other's company over a potluck-style dinner.

If $f:[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] \\rightarrow[2,3,4,5,1,7,8,6,9,10]$, then $f$ has one cycle of period 5 and one cycle of period 3 , so the period of $f$ is 15 .

For example, consider the function $f_{2}$ below:\n\n$$\nf_{2}:[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] \\rightarrow[2,3,4,5,1,10,9,10,7,3]\n$$\n\nNote that $s_{1}=2+3+4+5+1+10+9+10+7+3 \\neq 55$, so $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ is not immediately periodic. But $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ is eventually periodic, as the following argument shows. The function $f_{2}$ has two cycles: $1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow 4 \\rightarrow 5 \\rightarrow 1$, and $7 \\rightarrow 9 \\rightarrow 7$. There are also two paths that meet up with the first cycle: $6 \\rightarrow 10 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow \\cdots$ and $8 \\rightarrow 10 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow \\cdots$. Thus for all $k$ in $T, f_{2}\\left(f_{2}(k)\\right)$ is an element of one of these two extended cycles. Thus $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ eventually becomes periodic.\n\nThe criterion that the function be many-to-one is necessary, but not sufficient, for $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ to have period greater than 1 . To see why, consider the function $g:[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] \\rightarrow$ $[2,3,4,5,6,1,8,7,8,7]$. This function is many-to-one, and contains two cycles, $1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow$ $3 \\rightarrow 4 \\rightarrow 5 \\rightarrow 6 \\rightarrow 1$ and $7 \\rightarrow 8 \\rightarrow 7$. But because $g(9)=8$ and $g(10)=7$, the sum $s_{1}=2+3+4+5+6+1+8+7+8+7$, while $s_{2}=3+4+5+6+1+2+7+8+7+8$. In fact, for $n>1, s_{n+1}=s_{n}$, because applying $f$ only permutes the 6 -cycle and switches the two 7 's and two 8's. That is, in the list $\\underbrace{(g \\circ \\cdots \\circ g)}_{n}(1), \\ldots, \\underbrace{(g \\circ \\cdots \\circ g)}_{n}(10)$, the values 7 and 8 both show up exactly twice. This cycle is balanced: each of its elements shows up the same number of times for all $n$ in the list $\\underbrace{(g \\circ \\cdots \\circ g)}_{n}(1), \\ldots, \\underbrace{(g \\circ \\cdots \\circ g)}_{n}(10)$, for all $n$ after a certain point. The conclusion is that not all many-to-one functions produce unbalanced cycles.\n\nThere are two ways a function $g$ can produce balanced cycles. First, the cycles can be selfcontained, so no element outside of the cycle is ever absorbed into the cycle, as happens with the 6-cycle in the example above. Alternatively, the outside elements that are absorbed into a cycle can all arrive at different points of the cycle, so that each element of the cycle occurs equally often in each iteration of $g$. In the example above, the values $g(9)=7$ and $g(10)=8$ balance the $7 \\rightarrow 8 \\rightarrow 7$ cycle. On the other hand, in the function $f_{2}$ above, $f(f(6))=f(f(8))=f(f(1))=3$, making the large cycle unbalanced: in $s_{2}$, the value 3 appears three times in $s_{2}$, but the value 2 only appears once in $s_{2}$.\n\nThe foregoing shows that only unbalanced cycles can affect the periodicity of $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$. Because each element of a balanced cycle occurs equally often in each iteration, the period of that component of the sum $s_{n}$ attributed to the cycle is simply 1. (The case where $f$ is a permutation of $S$ is simply a special case of this result.) In the above example, the large cycle is\n\n\n\nunbalanced.

For the purposes of solving this problem, it is sufficient to note that unbalanced cycles can affect $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ 's periodicity.\n\nFinally, note that an unbalanced $k$-cycle actually requires at least $k+1$ elements: $k$ to form the cycle, plus at least 1 to be absorbed into the cycle and cause the imbalance. For the original set $S$, one way to create such an imbalance would be to have $f(20)=f(1)=$ $2, f(2)=3, f(3)=4, \\ldots, f(19)=1$. This arrangement creates an unbalanced cycle of length 19. But breaking up into smaller unbalanced cycles makes it possible to increase the period of $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ even more, because then in most cases the period is the least common multiple of the periods of the unbalanced cycles. For example, $f:[1,2,3, \\ldots, 20]=$ $[2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,1,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,11,11,11]$ has an unbalanced cycle of length 9 and an unbalanced cycle of length 8 , giving $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ a period of 72 .\n\nSo the goal is to maximize $\\operatorname{lcm}\\left\\{k_{1}, k_{2}, \\ldots, k_{m}\\right\\}$ such that $k_{1}+k_{2}+\\cdots+k_{m}+m \\leq 20$. With $m=2$, the maximal period is 72 , achieved with $k_{1}=9$ and $k_{2}=8$. With $m=3$, $k_{1}+k_{2}+k_{3} \\leq 17$, but $\\operatorname{lcm}\\{7,6,4\\}=84<\\operatorname{lcm}\\{7,5,4\\}=140$. This last result can be obtained with unbalanced cycles of length 4,5 , and 7 , with the remaining four points entering the three cycles (or with one point forming a balanced cycle of length 1, i.e., a fixed point). Choosing larger values of $m$ decreases the values of $k$ so far that they no longer form long cycles: when $m=4, k_{1}+k_{2}+k_{3}+k_{4} \\leq 16$, and even if $k_{4}=2, k_{3}=3$, and $k_{2}=5$, for a period of 30 , the largest possible value of $k_{1}=6$, which does not alter the period. (Even $k_{1}=7, k_{2}=5$, and $k_{3}=k_{4}=2$ only yields a period of 70 .) Thus the maximum period of $s_{n}$ is $\\mathbf{1 4 0}$.

The constant term is 2, and its factors are $\\pm 1, \\pm 2$. The leading coefficient is 1, and its only factors are $\\pm 1$. Therefore, the possible rational roots are $\\pm 1, \\pm 2$.\n\n## Step 3: Test the possible roots\nWe can test these possible roots by substituting them into the polynomial to see if any of them are actual roots.

Rearranging the first equation, we get $c = -6 - a$. Substituting this into the previous equation, we get $a(-6-a) + \\frac{2}{d} + d^2 = 2d$.

Therefore, we have $AC = y + z$.\n## Step 3:  The trisector of angle $B$ divides the opposite side $AC$ in the ratio $1:2$. This means that $AD:DC = 1:2$, or $y:z = 1:2$. Therefore, we can express $z$ in terms of $y$ as $z = 2y$.\n## Step 4:  We are given that $AB - BD = 7$. Since $AB = x$ and $BD = \\frac{2x}{3}$, we can express this as $x - \\frac{2x}{3} = 7$.

Since $AB = x = 21$, we have $y = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 21 = 7$.\n## Step 6:  Finally, we can find the value of $AC$ by adding $y$ and $z$. Since $z = 2y$, we have $AC = y + z = 7 + 2 \\cdot 7 = 7 + 14 = 21$.\n## Step 7:  Therefore, the length of $AC$ is $\\boxed{21}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{21}$"], "pred": ["21"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

If $n$ is not a multiple of 9 , then $l_{n}=L_{n}$, because as $x$ increases from $n-\\varepsilon$ to $n$, the floor function does not increase. This means that $f$ is actually constant on the half-closed interval $\\left(\\frac{n-1}{3}, \\frac{n}{3}\\right]$. If neither $n$ nor $n+1$ are multiples of 9 , then $l_{n+1}=l_{n}+1$. However if $n$ is a multiple of 9 , then $L_{n}=l_{n}+1$ and $l_{n+1}=L_{n}+1$. (The value of $f(x)$ increases when $x$ increases from $n-\\varepsilon$ to $n$, as well as going from $n$ to $n+\\varepsilon$.)\n\nHence on each interval of the form $(3 n-3,3 n)$, the graph of $f$ looks like 9 steps of height 1 and width $\\frac{1}{3}$, all open on the left and closed on the right except for the last step, which is open on both ends. Between the intervals $(3 n-3,3 n)$ and $(3 n, 3 n+3), f(x)$ increases by 2 , with $f(3 n)$ halfway between steps. This graph is shown below:\n\n\n\n<img_3187>\n\nOn each interval $(3 n-3,3 n)$, the average rate of change is $3<\\sqrt{11}$, so the steps move down relative $y=\\sqrt{11} x$ within each interval. At the end of each interval, the graph of $f$ rises relative to $y=\\sqrt{11} x$. Thus the last intersection point between $f(x)$ and $\\sqrt{11} x$ will be on the ninth step of one of these intervals. Suppose this intersection point lies in the interval $(3 k-3,3 k)$. The ninth step is of height $10 k-1$. Set $x=3 k-r$, where $r<\\frac{1}{3}$. Then the solution is the largest $k$ for which\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n10 k-1 & =\\sqrt{11}(3 k-r) \\quad\\left(0<r<\\frac{1}{3}\\right) \\\\\nk(10-3 \\sqrt{11}) & =1-\\sqrt{11} r<1 \\\\\nk & <\\frac{1}{10-3 \\sqrt{11}}=10+3 \\sqrt{11}<20 .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nBecause $0<19(10-3 \\sqrt{11})<1, k=19$ implies a value of $r$ between 0 and $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{11}}$.

This gives us $a_{3}=15-b_{3}$.\n## Step 7:  Additionally, we can solve for $a_{4}$ and $b_{4}$ using $c_{4}=a_{4}+b_{4}=2$. This gives us $a_{4}=2-b_{4}$.\n## Step 8:  We can then use the relationship between the terms of the geometric sequence to find the common ratio $r$ of the geometric sequence. We have $b_{2}=b_{1} \\cdot r$ and $b_{3}=b_{2} \\cdot r = b_{1} \\cdot r^2$.\n## Step 9:  Substituting the values of $b_{2}$ and $b_{3}$ into the equation $c_{3}=a_{3}+b_{3}=15$, we get $15 = (15-b_{3}) + b_{3} = 15 - b_{1}r^2 + b_{1}r$.\n## Step 10:  We can then solve for $r$ by rearranging the equation to get $b_{1}r^2 - b_{1}r - 15 = 0$.\n## Step 11:  We can factor the quadratic equation to get $b_{1}r^2 - b_{1}r - 15 = (r-5)(b_{1}r+3)=0$.\n## Step 12:  Since $b_{1}$ is positive, we have $r=5$.\n## Step 13:  Now that we have the common ratio $r$, we can find the value of $b_{4}$ using the relationship $b_{4}=b_{1} \\cdot r^3$. Substituting $r=5$, we get $b_{4}=b_{1} \\cdot 5^3 = 125b_{1}$.\n## Step 14:  We can then use the equation $c_{4}=a_{4}+b_{4}=2$ to solve for $b_{1}$. Substituting $a_{4}=2-b_{4}$, we get $2 = 2-b_{4}+b_{4}$, which simplifies to $0=0$. This means that we cannot find a unique value for $b_{1}$ using this method.\n## Step 15:  However, we can use the fact that $c_{1}=a_{1}+b_{1}=1$ to find the value of $b_{1}$. We have $b_{1}=1-a_{1}$.\n## Step 16:  We can then use the relationship between the terms of the arithmetic sequence to find the common difference $d$ of the arithmetic sequence. We have $a_{2}-a_{1}=d$ and $a_{3}-a_{2}=d$.\n## Step 17:  Substituting the values of $a_{2}$ and $a_{3}$, we get $4-b_{2}-a_{1}=d$ and $15-b_{3}-a_{2}=d$.\n## Step 18:  We can then solve for $d$ by equating the two expressions for $d$. This gives us $4-b_{2}-a_{1}=15-b_{3}-a_{2}$.\n## Step 19:  Substituting the values of $b_{2}$ and $b_{3}$, we get $4-b_{1}r-a_{1}=15-b_{1}r^2-a_{2}$.\n## Step 20:  We can then substitute the value of $r=5$ to get $4-5b_{1}-a_{1}=15-25b_{1}-a_{2}$.\n## Step 21:  We can then use the fact that $a_{1}=1-b_{1}$ to substitute for $a_{1}$ and simplify the equation to get $4-5b_{1}-(1-b_{1})=15-25b_{1}-a_{2}$.\n## Step 22:  This simplifies to $3-4b_{1}=15-25b_{1}-a_{2}$.\n## Step 23:  We can then use the fact that $a_{2}=4-b_{2}$ to substitute for $a_{2}$ and simplify the equation to get $3-4b_{1}=15-25b_{1}-(4-b_{1})$.\n## Step 24:  This simplifies to $3-4b_{1}=11-24b_{1}$.\n## Step 25:  We can then solve for $b_{1}$ by rearranging the equation to get $20b_{1}=8$, which gives us $b_{1}=\\frac{2}{5}$.\n## Step 26:  Now that we have the value of $b_{1}$, we can find the value of $a_{1}$ using the equation $a_{1}=1-b_{1}$. Substituting $b_{1}=\\frac{2}{5}$, we get $a_{1}=1-\\frac{2}{5}=\\frac{3}{5}$.\n## Step 27:  We can then find the value of $a_{2}$ using the equation $a_{2}=4-b_{2}$. Substituting $b_{2}=b_{1}r=\\frac{2}{5} \\cdot 5 = 2$, we get $a_{2}=4-2=2$.\n## Step 28:  We can then find the value of $a_{3}$ using the equation $a_{3}=15-b_{3}$. Substituting $b_{3}=b_{2}r=2 \\cdot 5 = 10$, we get $a_{3}=15-10=5$.\n## Step 29:  We can then find the value of $a_{4}$ using the equation $a_{4}=2-b_{4}$. Substituting $b_{4}=b_{1}r^3=\\frac{2}{5} \\cdot 5^3 = 50$, we get $a_{4}=2-50=-48$.\n## Step 30:  We can then find the value of $a_{5}$ using the equation $a_{5}=a_{4}+d$.

Each non-zero digit contributes an equal number of times, so there are 200 each of $1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9$. The same applies to the tens digit, except there can be the stray digit of 1 among the numbers 2010 through 2019, but again, these do not affect the product.

Thus the answer is $\\mathbf{1 2}$."], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Combinatorics", "code": ["## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of selfies required so that each pair of the eight students appears in exactly one selfie.\n## Step 2:  We can start by considering the total number of pairs of students. Since there are 8 students, the number of pairs can be calculated using the combination formula $\\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$, where n is the total number of students.\n## Step 3:  Substituting n = 8 into the formula, we get $\\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8(8-1)}{2} = 28$ pairs of students.\n## Step 4:  Now, we need to find the minimum number of selfies required to ensure that each pair appears in exactly one selfie. This can be achieved by using a combination of selfies with 2 students and 3 students.\n## Step 5:  Let's assume that we have x selfies with 2 students and y selfies with 3 students. The total number of students in these selfies is 2x + 3y.\n## Step 6:  Since each pair of students appears in exactly one selfie, the total number of pairs is equal to the sum of the number of pairs in the selfies with 2 students and the number of pairs in the selfies with 3 students.\n## Step 7:  This gives us the equation 2x + 3y = 28, as each selfie with 2 students contributes 1 pair and each selfie with 3 students contributes 3 pairs.\n## Step 8:  We also know that the total number of students in the selfies is equal to the total number of students, which is 8. This gives us the equation 2x + 3y = 8.\n## Step 9:  Solving the system of equations 2x + 3y = 28 and 2x + 3y = 8, we find that x = 10 and y = 0 is the only solution that satisfies both equations.\n## Step 10:  However, this solution is not feasible as it would require 10 selfies with 2 students, which is not possible since there are only 8 students.\n## Step 11:  Therefore, we need to find another solution. We can try to find a solution by trial and error, or by using a different approach.\n## Step 12:  Another approach is to use the fact that the total number of pairs is 28, and we want to minimize the number of selfies. We can start by trying to find the minimum number of selfies with 3 students.\n## Step 13:  If we have 3 students in each selfie, we can have 3 selfies with 3 students, which would account for 9 students. This leaves 5 students unaccounted for.\n## Step 14:  To account for the remaining 5 students, we can have 5 selfies with 2 students each, which would account for 10 students. However, this would leave 3 students unaccounted for.\n## Step 15:  To account for the remaining 3 students, we can have 3 selfies with 2 students each, which would account for 6 students. This would leave 1 student unaccounted for.\n## Step 16:  To account for the remaining 1 student, we can have 1 selfie with 2 students and 1 student left over. However, this would not be a valid selfie as it would not have 2 or 3 students.\n## Step 17:  Therefore, we need to adjust our approach. We can have 3 selfies with 3 students, which would account for 9 students. This leaves 5 students unaccounted for.\n## Step 18:  To account for the remaining 5 students, we can have 2 selfies with 3 students each, which would account for 6 students. This would leave 3 students unaccounted for.\n## Step 19:  To account for the remaining 3 students, we can have 3 selfies with 2 students each, which would account for 6 students. This would leave 1 student unaccounted for.\n## Step 20:  To account for the remaining 1 student, we can have 1 selfie with 2 students and 1 student left over. However, this would not be a valid selfie as it would not have 2 or 3 students.\n## Step 21:  Therefore, we need to adjust our approach again. We can have 3 selfies with 3 students, which would account for 9 students. This leaves 5 students unaccounted for.\n## Step 22:  To account for the remaining 5 students, we can have 2 selfies with 3 students each, which would account for 6 students. This would leave 3 students unaccounted for.\n## Step 23:  To account for the remaining 3 students, we can have 1 selfie with 3 students and 1 selfie with 2 students. This would account for 5 students, leaving 2 students unaccounted for.\n## Step 24:  To account for the remaining 2 students, we can have 1 selfie with 2 students. This would account for all 8 students.\n## Step 25:  Therefore, the minimum number of selfies required is 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 7.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$"], "pred": ["7"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

This gives us the following equations:\n## Step 4:  $\\log_4 x = \\frac{\\log_2 x}{\\log_2 4} = \\frac{\\log_2 x}{2}$, $\\log_8 (yz) = \\frac{\\log_2 (yz)}{\\log_2 8} = \\frac{\\log_2 (yz)}{3}$, $\\log_4 y = \\frac{\\log_2 y}{\\log_2 4} = \\frac{\\log_2 y}{2}$, $\\log_8 (xz) = \\frac{\\log_2 (xz)}{\\log_2 8} = \\frac{\\log_2 (xz)}{3}$, $\\log_4 z = \\frac{\\log_2 z}{\\log_2 4} = \\frac{\\log_2 z}{2}$, and $\\log_8 (xy) = \\frac{\\log_2 (xy)}{\\log_2 8} = \\frac{\\log_2 (xy)}{3}$.\n## Step 5:  Substituting these expressions back into the original system of equations, we get:\n## Step 6:  $\\frac{\\log_2 x}{2} + \\frac{\\log_2 (yz)}{3} = 2$, $\\frac{\\log_2 y}{2} + \\frac{\\log_2 (xz)}{3} = 4$, and $\\frac{\\log_2 z}{2} + \\frac{\\log_2 (xy)}{3} = 5$.\n## Step 7:  Multiplying each equation by the least common multiple of the denominators, which is 6, to clear the fractions, we obtain:\n## Step 8:  $3 \\log_2 x + 2 \\log_2 (yz) = 12$, $3 \\log_2 y + 2 \\log_2 (xz) = 24$, and $3 \\log_2 z + 2 \\log_2 (xy) = 30$.\n## Step 9:  We can then use the property of logarithms that states $\\log_b (m^n) = n \\log_b m$ to simplify the equations further.\n## Step 10:  This gives us $3 \\log_2 x + 2 \\log_2 y + 2 \\log_2 z = 12$, $3 \\log_2 y + 2 \\log_2 x + 2 \\log_2 z = 24$, and $3 \\log_2 z + 2 \\log_2 x + 2 \\log_2 y = 30$.\n## Step 11:  Adding the three equations together, we get $9 \\log_2 x + 9 \\log_2 y + 9 \\log_2 z = 66$.\n## Step 12:  Using the property $\\log_b (m \\cdot n \\cdot p) = \\log_b m + \\log_b n + \\log_b p$, we can simplify the equation to $\\log_2 (xyz)^9 = 66$.\n## Step 13:  We can then rewrite this equation in exponential form as $(xyz)^9 = 2^{66}$.\n## Step 14:  Since $xyz$ can be expressed in the form $2^k$, we have $(2^k)^9 = 2^{66}$.\n## Step 15:  This simplifies to $2^{9k} = 2^{66}$.\n## Step 16:  Equating the exponents, we get $9k = 66$.\n## Step 17:  Solving for $k$, we find $k = \\frac{66}{9} = \\frac{22}{3}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{22}{3}}$"], "pred": ["\\frac{22}{3}"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

Therefore, $TB = TC$.\n## Step 3:  We also know that the angle bisector of a triangle is the line that divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides. Since $AB = 14$ and $AC = 30$, the angle bisector of $\\angle BAC$ divides $BC$ into segments proportional to $AB$ and $AC$.\n## Step 4:  Let's denote the point where the angle bisector of $\\angle BAC$ intersects $BC$ as $D$. Then, we have $\\frac{BD}{DC} = \\frac{AB}{AC} = \\frac{14}{30} = \\frac{7}{15}$.\n## Step 5:  We can use this ratio to find the lengths of $BD$ and $DC$. Let $BD = 7x$ and $DC = 15x$. Since $BC = BD + DC = 40$, we have $7x + 15x = 40$, which gives us $x = \\frac{40}{22} = \\frac{20}{11}$.\n## Step 6:  Therefore, $BD = 7x = 7 \\cdot \\frac{20}{11} = \\frac{140}{11}$ and $DC = 15x = 15 \\cdot \\frac{20}{11} = \\frac{300}{11}$.\n## Step 7:  Now, we need to find the length of $AP$. Since $P$ is the intersection of the tangent at $A$ and the perpendicular bisector of $AT$, we can use the fact that the tangent to a circle is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency. Therefore, $AP$ is perpendicular to $AT$.\n## Step 8:  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of $AP$. Let $AT = 2h$. Then, $AP^2 + h^2 = AB^2 = 14^2 = 196$. Since $AT = 2h$, we have $AP^2 + (h)^2 = 196$.\n## Step 9:  We also know that $AT = 2h = TB + TB = TB + TC$. Since $TB = TC$, we have $2h = 2TB$, which gives us $h = TB$.\n## Step 10:  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem on triangle $ATB$ to find the length of $TB$. Let $TB = x$. Then, $AT^2 = AB^2 + TB^2$, which gives us $4h^2 = 196 + x^2$.\n## Step 11:  Since $h = TB = x$, we have $4x^2 = 196 + x^2$, which simplifies to $3x^2 = 196$. Solving for $x$, we get $x = \\sqrt{\\frac{196}{3}} = \\frac{14}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\n## Step 12:  Now that we have the value of $x$, we can find the length of $AP$.

We have $AP = \\frac{14\\sqrt{21}}{3}$ and $AC = 30$. Therefore, $[APC] = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{14\\sqrt{21}}{3} \\cdot 30 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{51}}{10} = \\frac{7\\sqrt{21} \\cdot \\sqrt{51}}{5}$.\n## Step 21:  We can simplify the expression for $[APC]$ by rationalizing the denominator. We have $[APC] = \\frac{7\\sqrt{21} \\cdot \\sqrt{51}}{5} = \\frac{7\\sqrt{1071}}{5}$.\n## Step 22:  Now, we need to find the area of triangle $PBC$. We can use the formula for the area of a triangle: $[PBC] = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot PB \\cdot BC \\cdot \\sin(\\angle PBC)$.\n## Step 23:  Since $P$ is the intersection of the tangent at $A$ and the perpendicular bisector of $AT$, we can use the fact that the tangent to a circle is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency.

Since the diagonals of a rectangle are perpendicular, the product of their lengths is equal to the area of the rectangle.\n## Step 5:  The diagonals of the rectangle are also the sides of the polygon, so we can express the product of the lengths of the diagonals as s * s * sin(2πk/n) = 6.\n## Step 6:  We can simplify the equation to s^2 * sin(2πk/n) = 6.\n## Step 7:  We can then substitute the expression for s^2 from the equation for the area of the polygon into the equation for the area of the rectangle to get: (n * s^2) / (4 * tan(π/n)) * sin(2πk/n) = 6.\n## Step 8:  Simplifying this equation, we get: n * sin(2πk/n) / (4 * tan(π/n)) = 6.\n## Step 9:  We can then rearrange the equation to get: n * sin(2πk/n) = 24 * tan(π/n).\n## Step 10:  We can use the double-angle identity for sine to rewrite the equation as: 2 * sin(πk/n) * cos(πk/n) = 24 * tan(π/n).\n## Step 11:  We can then divide both sides of the equation by 2 to get: sin(πk/n) * cos(πk/n) = 12 * tan(π/n).\n## Step 12:  We can then use the identity sin(2x) = 2 * sin(x) * cos(x) to rewrite the equation as: sin(2πk/n) = 12 * tan(π/n).\n## Step 13:  We can then divide both sides of the equation by tan(π/n) to get: tan(2πk/n) = 12.\n## Step 14:  We can then use the identity tan(2x) = 2 * tan(x) / (1 -

This gives us $\\frac{4}{3} < n < \\frac{128}{3}$.\n\n## Step 6: Find the integer values of n that satisfy the inequality\nSince n must be an integer, we can find the integer values of n that satisfy the inequality $\\frac{4}{3} < n < \\frac{128}{3}$. The smallest integer greater than $\\frac{4}{3}$ is 2, and the largest integer less than $\\frac{128}{3}$ is 42.\n\n## Step 7: Count the number of integers that satisfy the inequality\nWe can count the number of integers that satisfy the inequality by finding the difference between the largest and smallest integers and adding 1.

However, the specific numbers for positions 7 and 9 are not provided, so we will have to work with the general form of these sums.\n## Step 3:  The first step is to determine the value of A and B. Since the numbers are not specified, we will assume that the number from position 7 is a two-digit number, and the number from position 9 is also a two-digit number. Let's denote the two-digit number from position 7 as 10a + b, where a and b are the tens and units digits, respectively.
