Therefore, \\(\\angle CBD = \\angle CDB = 45^\\circ\\).\n\nNext, let's consider the quadrilateral \\(ABCD\\). Since \\(\\angle BAD = 90^\\circ\\) and \\(\\angle BCD = 90^\\circ\\), quadrilateral \\(ABCD\\) can be inscribed in a circle (it is a cyclic quadrilateral).

The least common multiple (LCM) of 90, 72, and 60 will help us determine the smallest angle that can be used to divide the circle into equal parts.\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorizations of the numbers:\n- \\(90 = 2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5\\)\n- \\(72 = 2^3 \\times 3^2\\)\n- \\(60 = 2^2 \\times 3 \\times 5\\)\n\nThe LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in these factorizations:\n- The highest power of 2 is \\(2^3\\)\n- The highest power of 3 is \\(3^2\\)\n- The highest power of 5 is \\(5\\)\n\nThus, the LCM is:\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(90, 72, 60) = 2^3 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 = 8 \\times 9 \\times 5 = 360\n\\]\n\nSince the LCM is 360, the circle is divided into 360 degrees. However, we are given that there are only 15 vertices, so we need to find a way to distribute these vertices such that the longest arc is minimized.\n\nTo minimize the longest arc, we need to consider the smallest angle that can be formed by the vertices of the polygons. The smallest angle between any two adjacent vertices of the polygons is the smallest central angle among the square, pentagon, and hexagon, which is 60 degrees.\n\nHowever, we need to check if it is possible to have an arc of 60 degrees between every pair of adjacent vertices. Since there are 15 vertices, the total number of arcs is 15. If each arc were 60 degrees, the total sum of the arcs would be:\n\\[\n15 \\times 60^\\circ = 900^\\circ\n\\]\n\nThis is not possible since the total sum of the arcs in a circle is 360 degrees. Therefore, we need to find a configuration where the longest arc is greater than 60 degrees.\n\nTo find the minimum possible value for the longest arc, we consider the distribution of the vertices.

Without loss of generality, let's assume \\(a = 24\\), \\(b = 27\\), \\(c = 25\\), and \\(d = 26\\).\n\nFirst, we drop perpendiculars from the ends of the shorter parallel side \\(a\\) to the longer parallel side \\(b\\).

Let's start by analyzing the given information.\n\nEach face of the pyramid is a triangle with a perimeter of 24 cm. Since the pyramid is a right square pyramid, each face is an isosceles triangle where the base is equal to the side length of the square base, and the two other sides are equal. Let's denote the side length of the base by \\( s \\). Therefore, the perimeter of each triangular face is given by:\n\\[\ns + 2l = 24\n\\]\nwhere \\( l \\) is the slant height of the pyramid.

The possible distances between any two vertices are 1, 2, or 3. Specifically:\n- Two vertices are at distance 1 if they are adjacent (i.e., connected by an edge).\n- Two vertices are at distance 2 if they are connected by a path of two edges but not directly by an edge.\n- Two vertices are at distance 3 if they are not connected by any path of length 1 or 2.\n\nWe need to calculate the number of ways to choose \\(Q\\), \\(R\\), and \\(S\\) such that \\(d(Q,R) > d(R,s)\\).

Using the properties of exponents, we can rewrite the left side:\n\\[\n2^{a-b} = 64\n\\]\nWe know that \\(64\\) can be written as \\(2^6\\), so we have:\n\\[\n2^{a-b} = 2^6\n\\]\nSince the bases are the same, we can equate the exponents:\n\\[\na - b = 6\n\\]\n\nNow we have the system of linear equations:\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\na + b = 2 \\\\\na - b = 6\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nThis matches the system of equations given in option (A). Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{A}\n\\]"], "pred": ["A"], "report": [null], "score": [true]}
